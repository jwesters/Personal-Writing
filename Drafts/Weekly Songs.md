26.  ["Raining Blood"](https://open.spotify.com/track/01Mpj13vURSO3cCLprPt5T?si=8095b5280d2d4a9c) - Slayer (Reign in Blood).  This album came out when I was three years old (1986) and is heavier than most music nowadays.  The rainstorm at the beginning of the song misguides the listener into arguably the most metal riff ever created by a band besides [Black Sabbath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Sabbath).  After that it launches into a breakneck speed riff that blows my mind.  Rumor is that [Tom Araya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Araya) (singer and bassist) didn't even play this on bass on the album recording.  Wouldn't surprise me as it's suspected that he doesn't play a lot of their stuff live.  I had heard of Slayer but was unfamiliar with most of their music until the [Diabolus in Musica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabolus_in_Musica) album.  During this album they toured with [Clutch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clutch_(band)) and [System of a Down](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_of_a_Down).  I had a cassette sampler of the three bands which had Slayer's ["Stain of Mind"](https://open.spotify.com/track/35CwMBsnwRDHpAY9F9wY6e?si=70494607997d4a36) on it, which in hindsight, is a nu-metal/rap song similar to Machine Head's ["From this Day"](https://open.spotify.com/track/2GQxHKJLYTDVQ5mtNhHD37?si=6a90b7628e6940ff).  I started working backwards through their discography and had a friend who gave me a few Slayer albums (Undisputed Attitude, Decade of Aggression, Seasons in the Abyss and Divine Intervention).  Funny enough, I just realized he gave me a few [Machine Head](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_Head_(band)) albums along with the Slayer cds.  Anyways, Raining Blood might be the greatest album closer of all-time. 

27. ["Ritual"](https://open.spotify.com/track/6yyQVQZP2jf0x7QTyrdAlN?si=49ed418c8ee745f1) - Downset (Downset).  I heard of this band by listening to [Rage Against the Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rage_Against_the_Machine).  The lead singer for Downset, Rey Oropeza, apparently had issues with some of [Zack de la Rocha's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zack_de_la_Rocha) lyrics and in the original demo for their song "Anger" he let this be known in his lyrics.  Funny enough, when Zach de la Rocha left Rage Against the Machine there was a rumour that Rey Oropeza was one of the individuals who may replace him.  This song is about the over-sexualization of women and is in a musical style that isn't traditionally known for the most feminist views (rap, metal and nu-metal).  The lyrics are eye-opening and great and the riff in the second verse... might be one of the greatest riffs in rap-rock history.  

28. ["Grade 9"](https://open.spotify.com/track/3HgmMujag0Fig1phtI08Wr?si=53793c9caf204214) - Barenaked Ladies (Gordon).  When I was younger I was babysat at a friend's house.  His mom babysat most of the kids in the area and it wasn't uncommon for there to be a dozen or so kids there.  My friend, Mike, had an older brother Shane who I looked up to.  I believe I was in Grade 4 or 5 (Shane was 4 years older than me) and he played this song on a cassette.  I just remember laughing my ass off at the part where it goes "They called me chicken legs, they called me four-eyes / They called me fatso, they called me buckwheat / They called me Eddie".  This was also the first CD I ever bought.  Sadly, Shane's brother who I was friend's with and his younger brother are now both dead.

29. ["Joyride"](https://open.spotify.com/track/2IbIlJrDkaG42bwzskcnJL?si=c6ac651f423e4be5) - Roxette (Joyride).  This was a song I loved as a kid and it doesn't age well.  Listening to it now, it's cheesy and not in a good way.  I remember that in elementary school we had to choose a song to dance to in gym class.  My two friends, Trevor, Ken and I chose this song.  Ken was mad as he wanted Corey Hart's ["Sunglasses at Night"](https://open.spotify.com/track/2NcnRXvKMhilK3CSXm325p?si=3ca3cfc8f14f4366).  I'm glad this is a time before video recording was easily done on your phone as a recording of this would cause me mental anguish.  Another student chose to dance to this song, Chris.  Chris was the "different" kid in school and looking back at some of the stuff he went through, I feel terrible.  I do remember him choosing this song to dance to and he did it by himself as no one wanted to be his partner.  During one part of the song he put his ass to the class and started to wiggle it back and forth.  This repeated for a prolonged period of time and I am wondering if his dad taught him this move.

30. ["Here's to the Night"](https://open.spotify.com/track/4tgeQrPu5xkrnwErym2JsJ?si=1ebd8f421f1747bd) Eve 6 (Horrorscope).  When looking up what album this song was off of, I saw a Wikipedia article for it with this: "Here's to the Night" is, along with "Inside Out", one of the band's best-known songs, and is known to be played at high school graduations and senior proms" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Here%27s_to_the_Night).  This was the song that was chosen for my graduation and even though I don't really like it, it does bring up memories.  A few people were trying to get the song ["Here I Go Again"](https://open.spotify.com/track/29pzjF6ZkzcW3ofgOVbF0t?si=876e86fceeb54129) by Whitesnake as our grad song but it was vetoed before a vote was even held.  I'm not sure why it was vetoed.  Maybe school administrators and the more outstanding, proper students thought that the more promiscuous girls of our graduation class would try to reenact the music video featuring [Tawny Kitaen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tawny_Kitaen) and dance on top of cars?  As I write this, my 20th high school reunion is coming up and I have a feeling that some of those aforementioned girls would leave some major dents on cars if they tried it now.   Going back to "Here's to the Night", it's a mediocre song by a mediocre band that was fitting for my graduating class of '01.

31. ["40 Oz. to Freedom"](https://open.spotify.com/track/0vtJ9Dq53hfXE3KyP1yPni?si=353b9314de0344f6) Sublime (40 Oz. to Freedom).  Sublime seems to be a band that all teenagers gravitate towards at some point.  I was looking at the age when the singer, [Bradley Nowell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradley_Nowell), died as I was curious to roughly know his age when writing the lyrics to this song.  He died at age 28 so he maybe was mid 20s when he wrote this song.  The reason why I bring this up is that I heard a comedian talk about Sublime and how the lyrics to their songs were written by a "grown-ass man".  It is quite right as the lyrics "You look so fine when you lie it just don't show/ That I know which way the wind blows/ 40 oz to freedom is the only chance I have to feel good / even though I feel bad" is quite cringe worthy when you think about it.  Still, Sublime were the band that teenagers loved when they were going through their drinking and/or smoking pot to be rebels phase.  I wonder how many teenagers were tempted to do heroin as Bradley Nowell did it and they thought he was cool?

32. ["Only God Knows Why"](https://open.spotify.com/track/1rAzW6aco1ZtxLRx4XOagB?si=05b2e00fa59e4fec) Kid Rock (Devil Without a Cause).  There are certain songs that you like which you should most certainly should not.  This is one of the songs for me.  [Kid Rock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kid_Rock) is the epitome of white trash.  A quick litmus test to see how white trash somebody is can be done by calling them "white trash".  If they don't think it's a pejorative term, and embrace the label, they are the highest/lowest/highest form of white trash.  This song has shitty lyrics, auto tune, and a "woe is me" feel to it.  Yet I can still remember slow dancing to this song in high school with a girl I dated for a few years and not hate it.  Maybe teenaged hormones changed how I interpreted this song?

33. ["Bandit"](https://open.spotify.com/track/0NK4nvdP73kEvQJtAzWjvI?si=096ece92be1e4b8a) Neil Young (Greendale).  I normally am not a huge fan of concept albums as I find it hard to listen through an album in one sitting.  They often self-indulgent and my simple mind often can't figure out what's going on.  Neil Young's album ["Greendale"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greendale_(album)) is a concept album, and it is one that fans either love or hate.  I haven't heard anyone say that it's "okay".  I'm a fan of it and it might be my favourite Neil Young album.  This song is just Neil and a down-tuned acoustic guitar.  The one string is tuned low and is used as a drone through out.  It rattles and it is more percussive than melodic.  The song has a somber tone to it but somehow it isn't sad (it's actually in a major key).  

34.  ["Chevrolet Way"](https://open.spotify.com/track/0L3bixyLalnqZXnIVwTiAh?si=0c75ce865d804dd2) Tariq (Basement Songs).  This is a song where, just from hearing the title alone, you think it would be part of an advertisement campaign.  I heard of this song and the artist through my sister who bought the album "Basement Songs".  I used to play video games while listening to music.  One summer I played the video game ["Super Metroid"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Metroid) while this album was playing.  Fast forward ten years later, I would drive back and forth from Lethbridge when I was going to university and would often listen to this album.  It brought me back to that summer where all I did was swim, play video games and work.  It was a relaxing time and the following lines from this song remind me of those summers:  

		"My girl she loves me good / I think she always will too / But in southern Alberta, southern Alberta / His neck went redder as the sky turned blue".

		I saw [Tariq](https://www.tariqmusiq.com/) live shortly before I went to university in Lethbridge and he omitted the line "His neck went redder as the sky turned blue" when he played this song.  It was a small folk concert and I had a chance to speak with him afterwards.  I should have asked him why this line was omitted.  

35. ["Takin' Care of Business"](https://open.spotify.com/track/0lzNXoZINVBLHWNIxKxWOo?si=b97b813c54a8445d)  Bachman–Turner Overdrive (Bachman–Turner Overdrive II).  This song can be described as being _meh_, at best.  The reason it's on my list is that one summer I went with a friend to his uncle's farm in Saskatchewan.  It was the summer between Grade 7 and Grade 8 and he and I were best friends.  He had a few deaths in his family over the summer so we didn't see each other much and right before school started up in the Fall, he invited me to go to his uncle's farm.  Either on the drive there or the drive back we were reading [Calvin and Hobbes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calvin_and_Hobbes) in his dad's van while the radio played.  It was a classic rock station and the DJ said something along the lines of that he thought this song was actually called "Baking Care of Biscuits".  I'm not normally a fan of humour like this (is it a pun joke...?) but to this day whenever I hear the song I think of that moment.  

36. ["Santa Monica"](https://open.spotify.com/track/37EJtTS7jT5WUyXGZzrwnI?si=69c15525956e49f5) Everclear (Sparkle and Fade).  This song is a song I listen to after my first girlfriend dumped me. Looking back on it, she should’ve dumped me as this was a song associated with her breaking up with me.  [Everclear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everclear_(band)) is one of those bands that had a great first record, second was OK and everything afterward was mediocre at best. A few of their later albums had a goof song or two but that’s it. Don’t believe me? Listen to their greatest hits album. this was also one of the first songs I could play on guitar that people would recognize when I played it.  The singer of Everclear, [Art Alexakis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_Alexakis), was a drug addict before this album was released. It was their first record on a major label and I am wondering if he is still chasing the high of having a hit single.  Reading about him on Wikipedia it says that “Alexakis was physically and sexually abused by older kids in his neighborhood. His brother George died of a heroin overdose when Alexakis was 12. That same year, Alexakis's 15-year-old girlfriend committed suicide. Not long after her death, Alexakis attempted suicide by filling his pockets with sand and lead weights and jumping off the Santa Monica Pier”. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_Alexakis#Early_life)  Now I feel like a whiny bitch for associating this song with a teenage breakup.

37.  ["Bulls on Parade"](https://open.spotify.com/track/0tZ3mElWcr74OOhKEiNz1x?si=d18aa10a9dee4ff4) Rage Against the Machine (Evil Empire).  I remember being extremely excited for this album and seeing the video for "Bulls on Parade" the same weekend Rage were on [Saturday Night Live](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live).  I recorded the SNL and was wondering why they only played one song on it.  I kept fast-forwarding and rewinding the tape trying to find their second song and never could.  Found out later that they had issues with [Steve Forbes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Forbes) (the host) and [NBC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC).  When I first saw the video for this song I thought the chorus was "Bonzai for Rage"  and not "Bulls on Parade".  However, when I saw the song title at the end of the video I was able to put 2 and 2 together.  For some reason I did not know when the album was being released and remember by dad and I visiting [Future Shop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_Shop) while my sister was fencing.  Every week she had fencing and my dad and I would just go around the city for an hour or two to kill time.  When I was in Future Shop I saw this cd on sale.  I never asked my dad to buy a CD or anything for me because he thought buying music was a waste of money (this was before CD burners were even a thing).  For some reason I got the courage to ask him if he could buy this CD for me and he actually did it.  When I was listening to the CD and [Vietnow](https://open.spotify.com/track/1lCC3flXDsXQrNPcvDojuI?si=558a195d95354fc3) came on he mocked the song by saying "fuck this, fuck that, fuck fuck fuck" which as a teenaged kid I found hysterical.  Even now I do.  Thanks dad.

38. ["Firestarter"](https://open.spotify.com/track/79CUrU5o2KAVDTNm4x3eGU?si=319d1771b19a42c4) Prodigy (The Fat of the Land).  I remember liking this song before the album ["Fat of the Land"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fat_of_the_Land) came out so I just Googled it to see that it was released as a single (or an EP, I'm too lazy to double check) a year before the album came out.  I was never a huge fan of dance music as I hate dancing with a passion.  I'm not normally a person who would use the word "vibe" but I would say [The Prodigy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Prodigy), and in particular this song, have a vibe or energy that's similar to [Rage Against the Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rage_Against_the_Machine), who I was a huge fan of at this time.  The song's lyrics are laughable but there's something punk rock to it which makes it aggressive yet catchy.  I didn't listen to much of The Prodigy after this album but in the recent years I've been listening to "No Tourists" which came out in 2018 and I would say it's kind of like "The Fat of the Land"  in terms of intensity.  

39. ["You Oughta Know"](https://open.spotify.com/track/3jS7bB0oXVOwGFZn3aE5NV?si=ff2d899d96b44cbf) Alanis Morrisette (Jagged Little Pill).  This album came out in June 1995.  I was twelve years old and got this album for a Christmas present.  Before you mock me for being a teenaged boy for getting this album as a Christmas present, I knew about 4-5 other people who got this album for a Christmas present and they were all guys my age.  Maybe parents were buying this for their adolescent sons so they could embrace their feminine side?   This was the first single from the album and even listening to it now, it still holds up.  I didn't know until years later that [Flea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flea_(musician)) and [Dave Navarro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Navarro) (who was in the [Red Hot Chili Peppers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Hot_Chili_Peppers) at the time) played on the song.  This song arguably started the female-angst pop genre but there's nothing wrong with a catchy pop song, especially one that has the lyrics "And are you thinking of me when you fuck her?".  Yes, I am Alanis.  I sure am.

40. ["Root Down"](https://open.spotify.com/track/18tgx070tbAM4TKxEwzWaG?si=28a403c20acc49eb) Beastie Boys (Ill Communication).  I got into this album because of the song ["Sabotage"](https://open.spotify.com/track/0Puj4YlTm6xNzDDADXHMI9?si=81f56e2f6b954009) which may be the best music video of all time.  I ended up buying the album because of this song and wasn't too familiar with the [Beastie Boys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beastie_Boys) before this album.  I thought they were more of a rock/punk band because of "Sabotage" and ["(You Gotta) Fight for Your Right (To Party!)"](https://open.spotify.com/track/5NLuC70kZQv8q34QyQa1DP?si=d405d0f859554e08).  I believe I heard ["Sure Shot"](https://open.spotify.com/track/21REQ1bCUWphT2QK3bLWYQ?si=4ee622e1d5e749e3) before getting this album and knew they did have rap songs.  Regardless, "Root Down" is one of those songs where they beat in it is so funky that it gets stuck in your head.  This was the early internet days so I didn't know until years later that the sample is from a song called ["Root Down"](https://open.spotify.com/track/19PG9tIlRRi56n7Tgywkxm?si=1d4842e554c04e73) by [Jimmy Smith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Smith_(musician)).  The original song is good but the sample they used to create this song is amazing.  

41. ["Kokomo"](https://open.spotify.com/track/7B22szTT8omMRmpQw6DMqV?si=13dea3cb00dc47b2) The Beach Boys (Cocktail).  This isn't my favourite song by [The Beach Boys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beach_Boys) but its probably the one which is most memorable for me.  I was unsure of what album this song was from and looking it up online saw that it's from the movie [Cocktail](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094889/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1).  Originally I thought it was a new song that was tacked on to a Best of The Beach Boys album.  Looking at the track listing, I realize that I have listened to the soundtrack for Cocktail numerous times but never have watched the movie.  Not sure if that's a good or bad thing.  Anyways, this song reminds of the summer between Grade 3 and Grade 4 where my family went to Florida on a vacation.  We went to Disney World but my family also got a rental car and drove around Florida.  My dad isn't a huge fan of music but for some reason he brought with him some cassette tapes to listen to while driving.  One of the tapes was the soundtrack for Cocktail and another was [Fine Young Cannibals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fine_Young_Cannibals).  "Kokomo" has the lyrics "Off the Florida Keys, there's a place called Kokomo" which now reminds me of my vacation in Florida as a kid.

42. ["Kick"](https://open.spotify.com/track/1p9oPZDiNymGw12BWv7WK3?si=7a54305165c842b1) Spanish Love Songs (Brave Faces Everyone).  As of this time, the newest song on this list.  I'm generally not a fan of singers who have a voice that has a constant warble to it, but I really enjoy this album.  This song reminds me of the people you know from junior high or high school who are essentially in the same place in life that they were 15-20 years ago.  They aren't necessarily bad people but have made bad choices.

		"I saw you last week / We haven't talked since graduation 
		You're moving H with a guy to catch up / But it's clear you're using 
		I didn't have the guts to be a better friend 
		But what's another ten grand gonna fix in the end?"
	
	After hearing this song I looked up the video for it on YouTube and... I can probably say I wouldn't have listened to the song in its entirety.  It's a douchey too-cool hipster type video.  So listen to the song first before watching the video.
	
43. ["Empty Sky"](https://open.spotify.com/track/4J3kArNud5C3B98dbCZXE4?si=c186aa7b420241ec) Bruce Springsteen (The Rising). This song or ["Atlantic City"](https://open.spotify.com/track/1Vp8U39YNsDfd6yVuaUq12?si=ce5256f9dd0c4ef4) are my favourite Springsteen songs.  I'm not a huge Springsteen fan and generally like his hits.  This song (and pretty much the entire "[The Rising"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rising_(album)) album) are written about 9/11 and dealing with it afterwards.  It's not an "America, Fuck Yeah!" album but written in a tasteful manner.  I remember after 9/11 watching a documentary about two French brothers who "were given permission by New York City Fire Department to film a documentary about a probationary firefighter. Their subject was Antonios Benetatos, who was assigned to the Engine 7/Ladder 1/Battalion 1 Firehouse on Duane Street in Lower Manhattan. They intended to make a film about the "probie's" first experiences as a firefighter. On the morning of September 11, the firehouse, under the direction of Battalion Chief Joseph W. Pfeifer, was called out on a reported "odor of gas" at Church and Lispenard streets. Jules Naudet rode with Pfeifer to investigate, while Gédéon stayed behind at the firehouse to film the "probie."  As the Battalion 1 firefighters examined the supposed gas leak, American Airlines Flight 11 flew overhead. Turning his camera to follow the plane, Jules Naudet taped one of only three known recordings of the first plane hitting the North Tower (Tower 1) of the World Trade Center in the 9/11 attacks." (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9/11_(2002_film))

	   I'm not emotional watching movies but cried like a baby watching this movie.  The only other movie I can remember crying to before this one was ["Fried Green Tomatoes"](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101921/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1) (Yes, the movie that Netflix recommends as a LBGQT movie).
	   
	   Back to the song, though.  In College I was in a Modern English class and in one of the anthology textbooks there were some poems and songs.  This song was in it but only the first stanza:
	    
		"I woke up this morning / I could barely breathe 
		Just an empty impression In the bed where you used to be  
		I want a kiss from your lips / I want an eye for an eye 
		I woke up this morning to the empty sky"
		
	I'm not sure if I owned the album before or after reading the lyrics, but they have always stuck with me.  
	
44. ["Life by the Drop"](https://open.spotify.com/track/4baw6m9OhZ1W8fPqWinZ3L?si=32a00c4405ae4f34) Stevie Ray Vaughan (The Sky Is Crying).  Just Stevie Ray Vaughan and a 12-string on this song.  I was unsure of what album this song is from as I remember hearing it on a best-of compilation album.  It is from "The Sky is Crying" which was released  in 1991 on his posthumous album, “The Sky is Crying.” (https://oakcliff.advocatemag.com/2015/07/the-story-behind-stevie-ray-vaughans-life-by-the-drop/).  This surprised me as I thought I had seen a video of him playing this song on MTV Unplugged but it ends up I misremembered and the song is "Pride and Joy".  At least I remembered it was played on a 12-string.
		
	 Stevie Ray Vaughan is often lauded for his guitar skills, and rightfully so.  However, in this song his guitar playing is second to his voice.  When looking up what album this song came from, I found out that the song was actually written by someone else, [Doyle Bramhall](https://www.texasmonthly.com/list/the-secret-history-of-texas-music/life-by-the-drop-1991/). 

45. ["Buddy Holly"](https://open.spotify.com/track/3mwvKOyMmG77zZRunnxp9E?si=69442654e9d64e65) Weezer (Blue Album).  I remember loving the video for this song and then loving the song.  I didn't own the album until 7-8 years after it came out but was a fan of [Weezer's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weezer) first albums.  This song has the catchy pop hooks and you have to love [Ric Ocasek's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ric_Ocasek) production on this album.  "What's with these homies dissin' my girl? / Why do they gotta front? / What did we ever do to these guys / That made  them so violent?" may be the best nerdy lyrics ever written.  You can definitely hear it on this song with the cheesy keyboard sounds.  It's interesting when you dig back into older music and listen to something, like [The Cars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cars), and realize how influential they were on music.  Now I know The Cars for something besides ["Moving in Stereo"](https://open.spotify.com/track/5xLfQuX5YAfog2JgPz0dpA?si=b96b0fd87c4743d2) and that classic scene from [Fast Times at Ridgemount High](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083929/).

46. ["Pink Moon"](https://open.spotify.com/track/4KROoGIaPaR1pBHPnR3bwC?si=1002dc38df7242a2) Nick Drake (Pink Moon).  I'm not entirely sure where I first heard of this song or album.  I may be misremembering but I believe it may have been in a magazine called [Blender](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blender_(magazine)) (it was a music magazine by the same people who created [Maxim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxim_(magazine)) magazine).   Looking the song up online, I found out that it was also used in an ad for [Volkswagen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen).  I find it to be a sad song but when you listen to the album "Pink Moon" in its entirety, this is probably the happiest song on the short album (less than 30 minutes).  It is sparse sounding; just Nick Drake on vocals, guitar and some overdubbed piano.  Yet, it is the only song on the album that features anything besides guitar and vocals.  I remember being in my early 20s and walking around town listening to this album at night, often when it was cooler out and it sort of became the soundtrack for this period in my life.  It's depressing when you find out that this is [Nick Drake's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Drake) final album before dying at the age of 26.

47. ["Bottle of Smoke"](https://open.spotify.com/track/1UEM1odhWQbVoUMw4WkZdR?si=6fd74c51426e438c) The Pogues (If I Should Fall from Grace with God).  I am not a cocky person about my looks but I know I sure as hell am better looking than [Shane MacGowan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shane_MacGowan).  I heard of [Rancid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rancid_(band)) before The Pogues but after listening to The Pogues you can tell that they clearly were an influence on [Tim Armstrong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Armstrong).  At the best of times I mishear lyrics and this song is no exception; I didn't know the lyrics to it until looking it up online.  It might be trite to say this but this is one of those songs that when you listen to you imagine getting drunk with friends at a pub.  At around 1:50 in the song it changes a bit and when MacGowan yells "Come on you bastards" you can tell he's drunk.  [Crock of Gold: A Few Rounds with Shane MacGowan](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11778272/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1) is a recent movie that has a lot of him talking about events in his life.  Thank god for subtitles.

48.  ["I Will Survive"](https://open.spotify.com/track/4THrHKyBL0yaDDw9yg37Zk?si=996197b152264acf) Cake (Fashion Nugget).  This song may have arguably started the cover craze of the late 90s.  So you can (possibly) blame them for [Limp Bizkit's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limp_Bizkit) ["Faith"](https://open.spotify.com/track/5MYsvAONqcsIVOwu2HTQ3p?si=c9d7e5b3bf854a44) and [Fear Factory's](Fear Factory's) ["Cars"](https://open.spotify.com/track/3fYnilKQlXbleOgHrfKogb?si=df0ece596dde4fad).  I normally love or hate covers and this one is one I love.  I had originally heard the original of this song by [Gloria Gaynor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gloria_Gaynor) but it was a male singing the song now.  This is kind of like how [Tiffany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiffany_Darwish) covered ["I Think We're Alone Now"](https://open.spotify.com/track/4uvjOKsp7mSjrDhWdkLPBY?si=4e50abbfcf8848fd) which was originally sung by males ([Tommy James & the Shondells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_James_and_the_Shondells)).  I'm also not a fan of profanity just for the sake of it but when [John McCrea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McCrea_(musician)) changed the lyrics from "I should have changed that stupid lock" to "I should have changed that fucking lock" it fits the song better.  Looking up the lyrics, I found out that Gloria Gaynor didn't like the profanity used in Cake's version (https://archive.is/20080504201527/http://www.stltoday.com/stltoday/entertainment/stories.nsf/music/story/E91C22DD527945C4862573ED007A7C69?OpenDocument).  Fuck her, Cake's version is better.  

49. ["Money"](https://open.spotify.com/track/0vFOzaXqZHahrZp6enQwQb?si=d9d071c258a141f3) Pink Floyd (The Dark Side of the Moon).  When I was 14 or 15 I used to go swimming all the time.  At night, I would go and sometimes stay after hours as I knew the lifeguards.  I was not working all the time (I had a greenhouse job but often had Saturdays or Sundays off).  When I got home from swimming around 10-11 I would play Super Nintendo and listen to music quietly to not wake my parents.  My dad had some really shitty records but had this album.  Maybe he was a stoner in high school?  I looked up when this album came out and he would have been 15 at the time.  Funny.  I enjoyed this album a lot and it's one of those records you need to listen to in its entirety.  I'm somewhat contradicting myself by saying that yet pointing out that this is the track that stands out the most to me.  My knowledge of musical theory is brutal but I even knew that listening to this song that there was something off about it (it is in 7/4 timing).  The song is catchy and the riff throughout just sticks with you.  I remember being dismissed early in high school and taking the bus home.  The bus driver was listening to the local radio station and they played classic rock at noon.  The lines "Money\ It's a hit \ Don't give me that do goody good bullshit" played uncensored and I thought that was pretty bad ass.  Yeah, I was that kid that found it edgy when you heard swearing when you thought it would be censored.     

50. ["Ship of Gold"](https://open.spotify.com/track/5yxIEkLk2F18UnVhBtwWBT?si=2ddc8c5a622140ab) Clutch (The Elephant Riders).  So far this is the only song on my list that I haven't been able to find on Spotify.  I could find a live version but not an album version, weird.  This song has the awesome call and response with the guitar right at the beginning and it's a classic meathead/[led zep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Led_Zeppelin) riff.  The opening lyrics "Tin shacks and catfish bones  \ Have been about all I've ever known.  \ The junebugs rattle and roll \ Around the old maypole."  It has an old rustic sound to it and the guitar solo with panning [wah-wah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wah-wah_pedal) pedal fits the motif of the song.  I first heard this song on [3 song tape demo](https://www.discogs.com/Various-SlayerClutchSystem-Of-A-Down-Diabolus-In-Musica-Tour-Sampler/release/4025558) when [System of a Down](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_of_a_Down) and [Clutch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clutch_(band)) went on tour with [Slayer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slayer) during the "Diabolus in Musica" tour.

51. ["Know"](https://open.spotify.com/track/1ByE7lUw6wWMTbCb3woHdK?si=5d76baf0e61d41d5) System of a Down (System of a Down).  After writing the above entry, I realized I haven't included [System of a Down](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_of_a_Down)  yet.  My introduction to them was through their ["Know/War/Peephole" demo](https://www.discogs.com/System-Of-A-Down-Know-War-Peep-Hole/master/784775) before they had their first album.  I was an [IRC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat) kid and somehow ended up finding out about them through a [Rage Against the Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rage_Against_the_Machine) channel I frequented.  It was a free cassette tape demo and I was hooked as soon as I listened.  The drum intro to "Know" was catchy as hell and [Serj](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serj_Tankian) has a voice that I hadn't heard at the time.  Later, listening to [Mr. Bungle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Bungle) I can definitely see that System of a Down were influenced by them.  It was something that was _off_ yet still catchy.  I still love that in music today.

52. ["Desert Search for Techno Allah"](https://open.spotify.com/track/2iIwHpNsRXERwsUHY7HIb4?si=46b9055f482b40ab) Mr. Bungle (Disco Volante).  The first [Mr. Bungle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Bungle) song I ever heard and I... didn't like it.  It was way too out there.  This song was sent to me over [ICQ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICQ) by someone who was also into [System of a Down](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_of_a_Down.  I was familiar with [Mike Patton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Patton) from [Faith No More](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faith_No_More) but this was just too odd for me.  I later got into Mr. Bungle after I found and bought their self-titled at a pawnshop.  It was still weird but accessible to me.  [Disco Volante](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disco_Volante_(Mr._Bungle_album)) is probably my least favourite of all the Mr. Bungle albums but this song introduced me to them.

53. ["South Dakota"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpSd9YW9A18) James McMurtry (South Dakota).  Another song not on Spotify so hopefully the link to YouTube stays up.  [James McMurtry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_McMurtry) is another amazing song writer, similar to [Jason Isbell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Isbell) in how he can tell a story in a song.  Might not be shocking to know that his father, [Larry McMurtry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_McMurtry), is a novelist.  He also adapted the screenplay for ["Brokeback Mountain"](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0388795/).
 
      Looking up the lyrics, I found this on [Genius.com](https://genius.com/James-mcmurtry-south-dakota-lyrics): "An unexpected early and wicked October blizzard hit western South Dakota from October 3-5 in 2013, killing 10,000 – 20,000 cattle.  
	  This is a story song about a fellow who lived through it and sees it as just one more of life’s cruel turns."
	  
	  Also, how can you not want to listen to a song when the first verse is the following?
	  
	  	"It was the 23rd of May 
		When I heard the sergeant say 
		"Fuck it, round up the usual suspects and call it a day 
		"We've got no time to mess around 
		"And I'm not dyin' in this shit-hole town 
		For a soldier's pay"
		
  54. ["Steam"](https://open.spotify.com/track/2wPTuonKLuHOc3034E7lLY?si=ee00b3ae32ab4db5) Peter Gabriel (Us).  I bought this album on tape because of this song and because I liked the music video.  Watching the video now, it still holds up in a 90s cheesy sort of way.  I haven't listened to this song in years and it really has a great bass line to it.  This song sticks out to me more of the fact that I bought the tape at a local mall.  Afterwards, my mom was hanging out at a perfume section of the mall and I was getting nauseous from all the scents.  She was a chatty Cathy and continued to talk for awhile.  On the drive home from the mall we were dropping my sister off at some place and she was taking forever to get out of the car.  I told my mom I wasn't feeling well so she was trying to get my sister to hurry up.  Well, she wasn't quick enough and I puked all my parents 1991 Ford Taurus.     
 
  55. ["Would?"](https://open.spotify.com/track/5sFDReWLrZHLFZFjHsjUTS?si=b44b3d4a65684711) Alice in Chains (Dirt).  I admit it, I was not into the "grunge" scene when it started up.  At the time I was between the age of 8-11 and my choice in music at the time was suspect; my first purchases on CD were Barenaked Ladies, Weird Al, a Ren and Stimpy compilation and The Crash Test Dummies.  When I got older and started to play guitar when I was 14 or 15 I started to listen to music that I could play on guitar so I gravitated towards punk and grunge music.  I started with Nirvana and made my way through a lot of the grunge bands (even those that were not considered grunge, like Pearl Jam).  I started to listen to Alice in Chains after [Layne Staley's death](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layne_Staley) in 2002.  I was familiar with them before he died but only knew a few songs.  After his death I bought or downloaded the album "Dirt" and it was probably the darkest album I had heard at the time.  Even though Jerry Cantrell wrote a lot of the songs, you could tell Layne Staley was tortured with his heroin addiction.  This song is the album closer and is about dealing with addiction.  It chillingly closes the album with the following lyrics which are almost a prediction of what would unfortunately happen to Staley:
	
	  	    "Am I wrong?
			Have I run too far to get home?
			Have I gone?
			Left you here alone
			Am I wrong?
			Have I run too far to get home? Yeah
			Have I gone?
			Left you here alone
			If I would, could you?

56. ["2:45 AM"](https://open.spotify.com/track/53q5m5Bpkr1Pin7mPKQxMi?si=e611464abb7246dd). Elliott Smith (Either/Or).  The previous song was somber and this song is even more depressing.  Once again, I'm not sure if I knew of Elliott Smith before or after his ["suicide"](https://www.theguardian.com/music/2004/mar/19/popandrock.elliottsmith).  The song is fairly simple in its composition (I believe four or five basic guitar chords and a bass run that has a few variations).  The reason I point this out is that I find some of Elliott Smith's songs quite complicated on guitar and he is also singing at the same time.  Specifically, ["Angeles"](https://open.spotify.com/track/2uwN3PDudlRkAKE3wA0OqJ?si=363b1fe0a2c54126) comes to mind it has some very quick finger picking in it.  The song is very sparse through out, just vocals and an acoustic guitar.  It is comprised of three verses, no chorus or bridge.  I the last verse of the song drums and bass join him as he says the following lyrics:

		I'm walking out on center circle
		The both of you can just fade to black
		I'm walking out on center circle
		Been pushed away and I'll never go back
		
       Who would have thought he was depressed?

57. ["Where It's At"](https://open.spotify.com/track/3Pdjem5pj41gilOgXqkNtL?si=e3a8ad0b9d554b2f). Beck (Odelay).  I remember loving this song because of the music video.  Funny enough, I don't remember the music video and had to look it up ["Where It's At" Music Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPfmNxKLDG4).  I also noticed that there's a huge difference in the song length between the music video and the album version (the music video is 2 minutes shorter).  This is the first time I noticed this.  Something about this song stood out to 12-13 year old me.  I did like Beck's song ["Loser"](https://open.spotify.com/track/5PntSbMHC1ud6Vvl8x56qd?si=9683c0c0f8df419c) but never really listened to anything else on the "Mellow Gold" album.  At this time most of the music I listened to was either on MuchMusic, something my sister or my friends had bought or something I borrowed from the library.  This song is a combination of distinctly different genres but still put together in a catchy pop song format.  That's the genius of Beck. 
	
58. ["Up Up & Away"](https://open.spotify.com/track/1RUTIdTnFs8lHSc0Zr4UJB?si=fb966399b5b7464f). Kid Cudi (Man on the Moon: The End of Day).  I first heard this song while watching a fairly shitty movie (I had to Google the song title to check what movie it was in as it was that forgettable).  The movie was [Jexi](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9354944/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1).  The one good thing I can say about the movie is that how many people are wrapped in technology and social media, primarily by using their phones, that they don't live in the moment.  "Up Up & Away" starts with a catchy delayed guitar riff and when the drums enter when the vocals do.    

		And those happy thoughts in my head  
		I'm feeling like I'm Peter Pan  
		Minus the tights and the fairy's  	
		Happy to see how far I've come to the same place  
		It began my dreams imaginations  
		Perfectly at peace so I move along a bit higher

       These lyrics mean to me someone who is comfortable in their own skin and is happy with life.  As someone who isn't comfortable in their own skin I envy those that are and are continuing to seek happiness in life, regardless of what others think.
	   
59. ["Act III Scene 2 (Shakespeare)"](https://open.spotify.com/track/5vPRX452ABQIbon7MVYYx5?si=204ea600b6e7492f). Saul Williams (Saul Williams.  I'm not sure how I heard of Saul Williams.  I believe it was either when I started listening to Sage Francis and looking for similar artists or checking stuff that Zack de la Rocha from Rage Against the Machine appeared on.  Saul Williams is a beat poet who ended up having a music career.  His style would be most similar to hip-hop for his first few albums.  He is one of those rappers where I find his lyrics more impactful when you read his lyrics than when you just listen to them as often you miss subtleties in his lyrics.  For example, I've heard this song probably a hundred times and reading the following lyrics today I realized I missed many of the things he said: 

		A machete in the heady: Hutu, Tutsi, Leone. 
		An Afghani in a shanty. 
		Doodle dandy yank on! 
		An Iraqi in Gap khaki. 
		Coca Coma come on! 
		
60. ["Snuff"](https://open.spotify.com/track/3RptaQ5Xb8WvtpItZ2f9Hi?si=fd2f183fc0e347fc) Slipknot (All Hope is Gone).  I was into Slipknot's first two albums but then stopped listening to them.  Looking at when their first two albums came out (1999 and 2001) and when their third and fourth albums came out (2004 and 2008) I'm thinking that over this time period I started listening to different types of music.  It is way different from their other songs and could be considered a nu-metal ballad of sorts.  It could be argued that Slipknot isn't generally known for their well... uh... "deep"  lyrics and this song might be their deepest in terms of lyrics (which, admittedly, isn't saying a lot).  Two lines that standout in this song for me are the following:   

		You couldn't hate enough to love  
		Is that supposed to be enough?
		
	I never realized there was a music video for this song and just watched it... don't watch it.
	
61. ["I Wish"](https://open.spotify.com/track/3LklW07tvdx2AHsgfi1Mng?si=a32d1d54f54a4b57). Skee-Lo (I Wish).  This might be my laziest post as this is something I have already written.  It was written for a university class I took in 2008.  Here's the original post: (https://82muchf00d.wordpress.com/2008/04/07/whatever-happened-to-skee-lo/)

      "It seems like almost everyone has got a shitty gift at one point in their lives.  While my grandma has bought me some cds that surprised me (such as [Sublime’s self-titled album](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sublime_%28album%29)) she also had bought me a few cds which I initially thought were jokes.  If you are reading this blog I’m pretty sure you know the album is [Skee-lo’s](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skee-lo#I_Can.27t_Stop) “I Wish”.

      I remember not minding the song when it came out but the rest of the album is horrible.  It’s almost like a parody of a rap album.  It seems like Skee-lo hasn’t done much since this album came out in 1995.  He released an album in 2000 and that’s about it.  Maybe I’m being optimistic but I think Skee-lo’s busy in the studio crafting what he believes to be the next “[Pet Sounds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pet_sounds)“.  It’s more likely that it will have more in common with “[Metal Machine Music](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_Machine_Music)” though."
	  
	  Back to now-my original post was a bit vicious and I did ask for a cd single of this album as a gift as I truly liked the song.  The reason this song stands out for me is for the comments I received from the above blog post.  I've never posted anything online before where in the feedback I've been asked to fellate rappers and been called the n-word (I am Caucasian).  
	  
	  Here are the [comments](https://82muchf00d.wordpress.com/2008/04/07/whatever-happened-to-skee-lo/#comments).  Please note that I am providing a trigger warning for these comments; not because of the language but because I might anger you for making fun of Skee-lo.
	  
 62. ["Can't Get It Out"](https://open.spotify.com/track/03gwBLH630cKYF1gr6hMGF?si=b86ce0741f0440f0) Brand New (Science Fiction).  I remember this album dropping out of nowhere in 2017 and I was pleasantly surprised.  I didn't start listening to Brand New until 2010ish which was after their last album ["Daisy"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daisy_(Brand_New_album)) was released.  I thought that the band wasn't going to release any new material even though they were still touring as it was 8 years between albums and they weren't known for having huge gaps between albums.  I saw them in concert in 2016 and they did not play anything from this album in concert.  

		Even though I am not religious, I am impressed by the religious imagery that Jesse Lacy has in his lyrics.  In particular, the pre-chorus to this song is what always stood out for me:
		
			I thought I was a creator
			I'm here just hanging around
			Got my messiah impression
			I think I got it nailed down

		These lyrics could be viewed as Jesse mocking Jesus Christ but I think it shows his growth as an individual and artist.  The band was huge and he was forced into the spotlight which is something he was not comfortable with.
			
63. ["Serve the Servants"](https://open.spotify.com/track/3w5Ekq9O8g0gGFEsT77Ydi?si=893177d8367b4485) Nirvana (In Utero).  Maybe the best lyrics to ever start an album:  

		Teenage angst has paid off well
		Now I'm bored and old
		Self-appointed judges judge
		More than they have sold
		
	I was aware of Nirvana before Kurt Cobain's death but couldn't say I was a huge fan.  When Nevermind came out I was 8 years old and didn't know what to think of it.  An interesting tidbit is that I bought "Weird Al" Yankovic's album "Off the Deep End" which had the song ["Smell Likes Nirvana"](https://open.spotify.com/track/3rREGSHjY1RmsTj81wL5X4?si=f8ba3ef434784d99) on it.  I saw the video for this song numerous times and when I saw the video for ["Smell Like Teen Spirit"](https://open.spotify.com/track/5ghIJDpPoe3CfHMGu71E6T?si=1cfa5764461c4512) I thought it was a parody of Weird Al's video.  
	
	I personally like the Nirvana album "Nevermind" more but I think that "Serve the Servants" is a better opening song for an album than "Smell Likes Teen Spirit".  This is not to say it's a better song but that it seems more indicative of the feeling of the album.
	
64. ["It'll All Work Out"](https://open.spotify.com/track/4fWi9tlWzs2XUejI8qjC6d?si=c4303c25d57a4509) Blake Mills (Break Mirrors).  I heard of Blake Mills as I was subscribed to a Patreon where a person transcribed a lot of [Julian Lage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Lage) songs.  He posted a transcription of this version of ["It'll All Work Out"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AetBG8e-ECs).  What first stood out to me is not only the intricacies of his rhythm playing but the fact he's also singing while playing.  My rhythm playing is sloppy at best and my singing is non-existent.  

	   What makes this song memorable to me is this verse might be one of the funniest and saddest I've ever heard.  Maybe because I've had a similar situation happen?
	   
		Now, I don't feel a speck of hate -  
		really, no, I'm trying to get my story straight -  
		when you called me from the car when you were on your way  
		with your friend from San Francisco that you told me was gay  
		and I guess he was a closet straight  
		Get it all out now  
		and it'll all work out
		
65. ["Part 1: "Acknowledgement""](https://open.spotify.com/track/7unF2ARDGldwWxZWCmlwDM?si=c284a060813f4b3az) John Coltrane (A Love Supreme). I've never been into jazz or been able to really _understand_  it.  One someone says something is modal I don't completely get it even thought I understand modes.  This album is also one of the rare albums where I bought the original LP (meaning the four songs, not an original pressing) and went out and bought the deluxe version later on.  It is interesting in that this album is viewed as being spiritual and/or religious yet it is essentially an instrumental album.  There's something with this track where the bass line comes in and Coltrane follows shortly afterwards that's just hits me every time.  There are certain parts in it where Coltrane plays his saxophone so hard that it sort of distorts.  I'm not sure the exact name for this but it hits me every time, even if I've listened to this song a hundred times.
	
66. ["Romeo Had Juliette"](https://open.spotify.com/track/6tM8cMX9S4AyRd5sDDrzhN?si=f5d1e4df0d884c8d). Lou Reed (New York).  A friend recommended the Lou Reed album ["The Raven"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Raven_(Lou_Reed_album)) to me and as it wasn't available in store I bought "New York" instead.  Later on I bought "The Raven"  and hated it and my friend bought "New York" and hated it.  This song starts with a false intro and then tape being sped up.  The album has a live sound to it where Lou Reed is coming out of one speaker and the other guitarist is out of the right.  This song starts with a very rudimentary chord progression and Lou Reed's lyrics are almost like a spoken rap but the lines don't often rhyme.

	The song begins with:

			Caught between the twisted stars the plotted lines the faulty map  
			that brought Columbus to New York  
			Betwixt between the East and west he calls on her wearing a leather vest  
			the earth squeals and shudders to a halt
			
	Which tells the story of Romeo and Juliette in gritty 80s New York.  Nothing portrays this scene more than these two lines from the final verse of the song:
		
			I'll take Manhattan in a garbage bag with Latin written on it that says 	 
			"It's hard to give a shit these days"
			
	I don't know what this exactly means but I love the lyrics regardless.
			
67. ["Wonderful Life"](https://open.spotify.com/track/4ryVNWVTXnYHRMUB0bv3no?si=ee1fe76035094f48). Nick Cave (Nocturama).  I first heard of Nick Cave not through his music but because of his writing.  At one point I was really into the author [Chuck Palahniuk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Palahniuk) and through him I heard of [Michael Gira](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Gira) (who coincidentally is another musician but I heard of him first through his writing).  Gira wrote a short story collection called "The Consumer" that many of Palahniuk's fans said was great but morbid.  Of course I went looking for it and couldn't find it online and it was selling for a ridiculous price on eBay in the early 2000s (I believe $300-$500 USD).  "The Consumer" was published on Henry Rollin's [2.13.6 label](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2.13.61).  Looking through the catalog of books on the site I saw a book titled ["And then the Ass Saw the Angel"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/And_the_Ass_Saw_the_Angel).  This title stood out to me and I eventually got the book (but haven't read it yet...).  I ended up buying this Nick Cave album and, honestly, I'm not a fan of it.  The only song I like is the first song.  There's a certain part in it at 1:40 where Nick Cave sings "There will be nothing between us, baby"  where the vocals cut out on the word between.  It's almost like he stepped away from the mic when singing this line and it gives me goose bumps every time I hear it.
	
68. ["What It's Like"](https://open.spotify.com/track/0nbuX7OZkEY5agMkpr98wS?si=28148d3d3d0b4295) Everlast (Whitey Ford Sings the Blues).  As I was a 90s computer nerd growing up, someone mentioned to me on [IRC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat) that one of the rappers from [House of Pain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Pain) became a solo act and had a rap/blues album that just came out.  I found this song on Napster or Kazaa and of course it probably took a 1/2 hour or so to download because of dial-up.  After the first listen I really liked it as it combined hip hop and story telling in songs which I loved at the time.  It's a great song but it doesn't excuse Everlast for his godawful cover of Johnny Cash's ["Folsom Prison Blues"](https://open.spotify.com/track/2CJYv37IEbvbACWgI8IeHx?si=d28a737b11984f41)

      If you ever want to hear the radio edit of the song [check this out](https://open.spotify.com/track/6Bh21G1OwdiRGnhnCV6v95?si=435a6e4796b14292).  I find the constant edits and abrupt noises more offensive than the original uncensored version.
		  
69. ["Bueno"](https://open.spotify.com/track/2SSBJhvMsujY94GK5JAtKs?si=afaa6c93426344eb) Morphine (Cure for Pain).   I ended up buying this album before hearing any music by the band.  I had heard of the band before and the CD was cheap so I bought it.  I was expecting a grunge rock band, sort of like Nirvana, and this song is anything but that.   This song is made up of slide bass guitar, saxophone, drums and [Mark Sandman's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Sandman) deep voice.  It is definitely a unique song and the riff played by the slide bass is catchy as hell.     

 70. ["4th of July"](https://open.spotify.com/track/0W5Pa3GW06IQ7BS5CbTTOM?si=417ee55b5a3a4ffd) Shooter Jennings (Put the O Back in Country).  Shooter Jennings was the worst concert I've ever been to and I'm not even sure he played this song at it.  He had all the energy live of a quaaluded octogenarian.  That said, I really like this song.  I normally hate "rah rah American" country songs but this song is catchy as hell, especially the chorus:

			You were pretty as can be, sitting in the front seat  
			Looking at me, telling me you love me  
			And you're happy to be with me on the 4th of July  
			We sang Stranglehold 'til the stereo  
			Couldn't take no more of that rock and roll  
			So we put on a little George Jones and just sang along
			
	    It is a simple four chord song but the lyrics make it stand out.  Check the song out if you haven't heard it but don't see Shooter live.
		   
   71. ["Wear It So Well"](https://open.spotify.com/track/7zobj12CJdA7gfKj5re1Ik?si=0b56aa4d29ea4f14) Far (Water & Solutions).  The first time I can remember hearing Far it was their cover of Ginuwine's "Pony".  It was uh... interesting.  I ended up downloading the album that song was on ("At Night We Live") and really enjoying the rest of the album.  I went back to listen to their previous albums and this song has always stood out for me.  There's a point in it where  Jonah Matranga screams "You look like hell" and the vocals distort.  I love this moment and it gives me goose bumps every time I hear it.
	   
   72. ["Dust on the Bottle"](https://open.spotify.com/track/0Xg68XXMRWzKQvD5S6BFvI?si=79e1f3bf81f9448c) David Lee Murphy (Out With a Bang).  As I have previously mentioned, I'm not a huge fan of country music.  I find the patriotism and the "girl left me"/"I got the girl" songs quite trite and predictable.  That said, this song is one of the "I got the girl" songs but I still love it.  I have a thing for songs with catchy choruses and this is one of them.  The lyrics aren't the greatest but the guitar riff is catchy.
	    
   73. ["Hip Today"](https://open.spotify.com/track/44aT0akZ0fmxybFOEaQSEp?si=578c20750eda4b7c) Extreme (Waiting for the Punchline).  I heard this song on a promo radio compilation that my mom bought from an SPCA garage sale.  I probably heard "More than Words" before this song but didn't put the song and this band together.  This song is off their last album and it deviates from the band's previous albums which could be considered hair metal (their third album was a bit of a blend between hair metal and rock).  There's something about this song that makes it funky but in a way different from the [Red Hot Chili Peppers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Hot_Chili_Peppers).  [Nuno Betterncourt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuno_Bettencourt) is an extremely talent guitarist and [Gary Cherone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Cherone) has pipes for days (although [Van Halen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Halen) fans would argue otherwise).  
	   
   74. ["All That She Wants"](https://open.spotify.com/track/6kWJvPfC4DgUpRsXKNa9z9?si=1cb3bc2471e649e1) Ace of Base (The Sign).  I haven't heard this song in years even though I've heard the song "The Sign"  every year or so.  This song does not hold up with the cheesy sound of waves at the beginning and the simple drum beat and whistling.  I bought this cd with my sister when I was in Grade 4 or Grade 5.  It was the only cd we ever purchased together and probably a good thing if this is any indication of our combined musical tastes.  My dad is not a person who listens to a lot of music (the only music CD I think he has ever owned is [Creedence Clearwater Revival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creedence_Clearwater_Revival)) but he would say that Ace of Base sounds like [ABBA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABBA) and... he's right.
	   
   75. ["Swing Life Away"](https://open.spotify.com/track/6GrrkiCRO3HYdgRpO4eKEL?si=26730f9aa7f04991) Rise Against (Sire Song of the Counter-Culture).  I bought this album without hearing any of the songs just because I've heard of the band Rise Against and knew they were kind of a harder punk band (basically not a punk pop [Blink 182](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blink-182) or [Green Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blink-182) type band).  This song is a ballad (I wasn't sure if it was or not but on the Wikipedia article for [this song](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_Life_Away) it says it is so I guess it is.  If you haven't guessed it by now, the song is way different from the rest of album in that it's acoustic.  For some reason I often find acoustic songs by punk bands as insincere but this isn't the case.  The song came out in 2005 and I was in my early 20s.  At that point a lot of my friends from junior high and high school had moved on with their lives (either in serious relationships, moved away for school/work or both).  These lyrics resonated with me then and still do today:  

				I've got some friends, some that I hardly know  
				But we've had some times, I wouldn't trade for the world  
				We chase these days down with talks of the places that we will go 
				
  76. ["I Could Have Lied"](https://open.spotify.com/track/0NSbiBKXoODbsPwjSivfBr?si=372de0812bc044d1) Red Hot Chili Peppers (Blood Sugar Sex Magik).  Another one of those songs that sticks out to me as it happened at the end (or towards the end) of a relationship.  This list of favourite/memorable songs is now turning out to be like a teenaged girls LiveJournal from the mid 00s.  

		I was always conflicted about the following lyrics.  I wasn't sure if they were  Anthony Kiedis talking about a relationship when he cheated on someone or if he fell back to his heroin addiction:

				I could have lied, I'm such a fool  
				My eyes could never, never, never keep their cool  
				Showed her and I told her how  
				She struck me but I'm fucked up now
				
  77.  ["Wring It Out"](https://open.spotify.com/track/0JCeVdVxPFsLrVj0En0R1D?si=6766fc966de84335) Rival Schools (Pedals).  I have no idea where I first heard of Rival Schools.  I have a sticker of them on my guitar case from probably 20 years ago and I'm thinking I either got it at the Warped Tour (I went in '01 and '02) or from the band promo stuff I used to do.  I liked a few songs off their first album ["United by Fate"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_by_Fate) but this album is solid all the way through.  There's something about how this song begins where the intro chords sound *off* to me and I'm not sure why.  I don't have the best ear so maybe it's just me.  Also, IMO the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6QzdZ7GpwQ) has nothing to do with the song lyrics but it's still fun to watch. 
				
  78. ["When I Needed You"](https://open.spotify.com/track/3SopOSh7ff9vYC1WZAFq7O?si=44717ded76c343fa) Carly Rae Jepsen (E•MO•TION).  I legitimately like this song and not in an ironic, Brooklyn-hipster way.  I heard about this song from [Song Exploder](https://songexploder.net/carly-rae-jepsen) and it is catchy as hell.  It is hard for me to explain why I like this song as it is both a typical pop song but at the same time it isn't.  It is in a major key but the lyrics are about a relationship ending.  The bass line and bass fill on this song though... that's why I love it.
	  
  79. ["Long Way Down"](https://open.spotify.com/track/1J307YEKcn9pH7QT5fXTLt?si=7422a1edce734a7f) The Goo Goo Dolls (A Boy Named Goo). This song is a banger, and it might surprise some people but The Goo Goo Dolls were originally signed to [Metal Blade Records](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_Blade_Records) (this label originally signed Metallica).  This song is not a metal song by any means but the riff is catchy and the chorus... is just wow:

				Long way down  
				I don't think I'll make it on my own  
				Long way down  
				I don't want to live in here alone  
				Long way down  
				I don't think I'll make it on my own
				
		This song is ingrained in my memories as I had a friend who would often be the "designated driver" (there's a reason I put that in quotes as his DUI might contradict this) and he had this song on a CD in his car.  It is almost like a ["Wayne's World"](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0105793/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1) moment in that this song would play and people would just mumble along to the verse but as soon as the chorus would come in people would be singing along at the top of their lungs.  You never realize at the time that those dumb moments as kid will stand out for you later in life.
			
80.  ["No Shelter"](https://open.spotify.com/track/2qTZMq2MUC20HFGQghNpVF?si=a2011ae0491849ff) Rage Against the Machine (Godzilla Soundtrack).  I was curious when this soundtrack came out as I remember wanting to go see this movie when it was released but it was sold out.  I ended up seeing [Six Days Seven Nights](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120828/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_28) instead.  I had to check when Godzilla came out to see when this movie came out as it was that forgetful.  This song came out when I was a huge Rage fan but still had dial-up internet and songs were difficult to find unless you used IRC or FTPs (this is before the Kazaa and Napster days).  My buddy bough the album and I was eager to listen to the song so he held up the phone to the speaker while the song played.  Obviously the quality was horrendous, but damn it, I got to hear the song.  

		Rage was criticized for being on a major motion picture soundtrack but the following entry from Wikipedia regarding the soundtrack makes an interesting point:
			
		"A notable entry is "[No Shelter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Shelter "No Shelter")" by [Rage Against the Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rage_Against_the_Machine "Rage Against the Machine"), in which a line in the lyrics of the song appears to criticize the film for distracting the public, saying, "Godzilla, pure motherfucking filler. Get your eyes off the real killer.""
			
81. ["Gasoline"](https://open.spotify.com/track/6Q1m1GyNxyOwZ2ud3p7XoS?si=18f10fc3ab504e60) I Prevail (Trauma).  Another newer song on this list, I first heard of this band when a few friends and I went on a vacation trip to British Columbia.  The one friend, who is notorious for being late, was late meeting up with us in Calgary.  Ryan, my friend who drove, joked that we should go to a golf course in Calgary and play 9 holes and by the time we finish Andrew would be there.  We didn't end up golfing but he was right; Andrew was that late and we ended up meeting up with him in British Columbia as he was so late and told us just to go.  While we were driving through the mountains my cell couldn't get any reception (not out of the ordinary in the mountains).  We were listening to satellite radio and ["Bow Down"](https://open.spotify.com/track/5qD3Qv8Wu3r5uRD0DahcZy?si=09dd20e77c5e4ff8) was played by this band.  I mentioned to Ryan that I liked this song and he either played "Gasoline" on his phone or it came up later on satellite radio.  This song is just a meathead song with a heavy riff but there's something about it that gets me pumped up.   
	
82.  ["Don't Call Me White"](https://open.spotify.com/track/0cntShbC3GmWXygfH98brk?si=08daa439958d44cf) NOFX (Punk in Drublic).  I somehow got into punk music ironically while I was fencing (I did it for 2-3 years and wasn't that good at it).  This was the first song I heard by NOFX and I had to go out and buy the cd.  Once again, this was in the pre-MP3 days of the internet so I hadn't heard any other songs on it.  This song always stands out for me on the album as it's arguably the most "political" song NOFX ever recorded.  I also didn't know until 3-4 years after having this album that the title is a [spoonerism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoonerism) for "Drunk in Public". 
	
83.  ["To Be Young (Is to Be Sad, Is to Be High)"](https://open.spotify.com/track/0aLk2Za7r0eGlLOepW2hzL?si=dde33801153b431c) Ryan Adams (Heartbreaker).  This was an album I downloaded from [Newsgroups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet_newsgroup) after Ryan Adams was featured in Blender Magazine (and yes, I thought I was witty thinking of the [Bryan Adams'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryan_Adams) joke with his name).  This song is a great opening to an album (I don't consider the opening track which is like a 30 second conversation without music to be an opener).   It opens in a way that reminds me of a drunken country live show.  

	  At around 2 minutes into the song the bridge happens and the songs becomes sad, almost melancholy.  It almost sounds like a different song until you listen to the lyrics:  

				Ooh, the days, the rain would fall your way  
				Ooh, the days, the rain would fall your way  
				And you'd be high 'cause you got sad  
				'Cause you got sad

84.  ["Crazy Train"](https://open.spotify.com/track/7ACxUo21jtTHzy7ZEV56vU?si=db8e02732c914e81) Ozzy Osbourne (Blizzard of Ozz). Of course the opening riff is one of the first things I learned on guitar.  It is such a catchy riff and surprisingly easy.  I don't remember when I first heard this song (I didn't listen to much Black Sabbath or Ozzy Osbourne as a kid or teen) but I've always loved this riff.  After learning the opening riff I tried learning the verse and, man..., this is the time I wish I took guitar lessons to learn how to properly pick.  I don't strum with my wrist but my entire hand so for me to play the verse riff it was almost like I was tremolo picking the open A strings and then hitting the chords.  Sloppy as hell and took me forever to get it done.  The chords that are played on the verse are chords that weren't in the rock and punk music I listened to at the time.  I think this opened me up to messing around with different chord shapes in my playing.  My musical theory is minimal but I do enjoy placing my fingers randomly on the fret board, strumming and hearing the resulting sound.

85.  ["Six Days"](https://open.spotify.com/track/2f5XeVrRyC4iLVyxAmacsC?si=cfe1bc3df0174e63) DJ Shadow (The Private Press). I first heard about DJ Shadow from Blender magazine.  They had an article on "Endtroducing" which sounded interesting to me, especially how it was [created](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endtroducing.....#Composition).  I went to a local record store and couldn't find "Endtroducing" so bought the "The Private Press".  I honestly wasn't a huge fan of the album (I later bought "Endtroducing" and prefer it) but "Six Days" stands out from the rest of the songs on the album as it's not an instrumental, which many of the tracks on the album are.  I remember listening to this song when driving late at night after work to go shoot pool with a friend of mine.  It would be a maybe 15-20 minute drive to meet up with him and I remember playing this song on repeat on the drive there and back quite a few times.  Whenever I hear this song it reminds me of the drive to go shoot pool against him (and get my ass royally kicked by him).

86. ["Jump"](https://open.spotify.com/track/27AHAtAirQapVldIm4c9ZX?si=8a26cdce69a44dc4) Kris Kross (Totally Krossed Out).  So this is not a song I like.  I wouldn't say I hate it but I just have a memory of it.  In 1991 I went to Disney World and it was its [20th Anniversary](https://wdwnt.com/2021/06/timekeeping-1991-walt-disney-worlds-20th-anniversary-in-spectromagic/).  There was a [special concert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbpJbtNXVxE) to celebrate this on July 4th and Kris Kross played.  I didn't get to see them in concert as it was late at night and my family and I were staying in [Kissimee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kissimmee,_Florida).  We had been to Disney World earlier that day.  I was a pissy 8 year old and told my dad I wanted to go and threw a tamptrum.  He told me to find a way there.  I threatened to run away and he called my bullshit.  I was a kid who was afraid to take a piss at the theatre by myself and my dad knew I wouldn't run away.  Anyways, this song reminds me of that time.  

87. ["The Blacker The Berry"](https://open.spotify.com/track/5Mtt6tZSZA9cXTHGSGpyh0?si=8728c4f2bfd14535) Kendrick Lamar (To Pimp a Butterfly). I'm going to sound like a middle-aged man here (as I am), but I'm not a fan of most modern hip-hop.  By that, I mean any rap in the last 5-10 years.  I'm not a fan of auto-tune and I just don't really like most of it.  I like Denzel Curry and maybe a few other current rap artists, but the majority of them I'm not a fan of.  When I first heard of Kendrick Lamar, I listened and to be honest, wasn't sure why he was so popular.   I got into Thundercat and saw that he played the bass line on ["King Kunta"](https://open.spotify.com/track/0N3W5peJUQtI4eyR6GJT5O?si=335a37f1c354441f).  I loved this song at first listen and thought I would listen to the entire album.  "The Blacker The Berry" stood out to me as throughout it Kendrick Lamar is angrily spitting venom.  The end of song caught me off guard:

			Or tell Georgia State "Marcus Garvey got all the answers"  
			Or try to celebrate February like it's my B-Day  
			Or eat watermelon, chicken, and Kool-Aid on weekdays  
			Or jump high enough to get Michael Jordan endorsements  
			Or watch BET cause urban support is important  
			So why did I weep when Trayvon Martin was in the street?  
			When gang banging make me kill a nigga blacker than me?  
			Hypocrite!

88. ["What's the Use?"](https://open.spotify.com/track/2dgrYdgguVZKeCsrVb9XEs?si=f3cc847a962a4d30) Mac Miller (Swimming).  Yes, I'm full of crap.  I mentioned previously that I wasn't a fan of modern rap but here's my excuse... [Thundercat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thundercat_(musician)) is on this track too!  I actually first heard this song from [Mac Miller's NPR Tiny Desk Concert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrR_gm6RqCo&t=341s)  This bass line is catchy as hell and... I initially hated the rapping but it's grown on me over time.  The one thing that stands out for me is actually from the NPR video when Thundercat plays the fill at 7:44 and just the reaction of Mac, Thundercat and the entire band.  Just pure joy even though the song isn't necessarily a happy one.  And before you ask, I started listening to Mac Miller after he died so I'm a bandwagon jumper I guess.

89.  ["For the Love of God"](https://open.spotify.com/track/5m5I3KcV83zf2p2qbsnr3y?si=249909cc187c49d3) Steve Vai (Passion and Warfare).  I'm a self-taught guitarist so I play guitar quite poorly.  My rhythm playing has always been pretty awful so I diluted myself into thinking it's because I was "born to play lead guitar".  I find more guitar instrumental musical quite self-indulgent and this song is too.  I worked at a fast food restaurant when I was in high school and after work I would come home and practice playing this song on my [Ibanez RG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibanez_RG) (unplugged to not wake my parents of course).  I never got around to learning the whole song but could play the first 30-45 seconds of the song.  I also could play the tremolo picked part in the solo.  This is one of the few guitar instrumental songs I can play to my friends who don't play an instrument and they won't mind it.  Just don't watch Steve Vai playing it live... It looks like he's having a bit too much fun playing...   
 
90. ["Coup D'etat"](https://open.spotify.com/track/6J24QBZuxVxhTshU8sf7rz?si=6a8805eb45a94383) Refused (Songs to Fan the Flames of Discontent).  I first heard this album from a co-worker of mine at A&W.  He ended up burning me this album and at first, I wasn't a huge fan.  He said give it a few listens and this song stands out for me on the album.  It's just a chaotic song from the beginning.  At the breakdown/bridge of the song, the lead singer, [Dennis Lyxzén](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Lyxz%C3%A9n) screams the following lyrics which always resonated with me:

		I will not die for you  
		I will not kill for you  
		I will not fight for you  
		I will hold your burning flag in my hand  
		As I watch your empire fall

91. ["Liar"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaysTVcounI) Rollins Band (Weight).  Another song I can't find on Spotify.  I think this may become the trend with some artists and bands leaving [Spotify](https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/music/story/2022-01-30/spotify-joe-rogan-covid-neil-young-list-of-artists#:~:text=Entertainment%20figures%20Neil%20Young%2C%20left,have%20cut%20ties%20with%20Spotify.&text=Veteran%20singer%2Dsongwriter%20Neil%20Young,SPOTIFY's%20deadly%20misinformation%20about%20COVID.%E2%80%9D) but I'm unsure if Rollins Band were ever on Spotify.  I first heard this song on [Beavis and Butthead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beavis_and_Butt-Head)  when I was in Grade 5 or Grade 6 and I liked the intensity of Rollins.  The song goes from him quietly talking to the listener, almost lulling them into a false sense of security before he goes off with: 

		cause I'm a liar  
		yeah I'm a liar  
		I'll tear your mind out  
		I'll burn your soul  
		I'll turn you into me 

	Also, the part where Rollins screams and his neck veins pop out was something my friend and I in Grade 6 would imitate.  Got to love juvenile humour. 

92. ["Ritual"](https://open.spotify.com/track/5ZiTzbMB53mIiP3I4uQCmt?si=c0f806ac04e8480d) Ghost (Opus Eponymous).  In High School I went through a death metal phase, listening to bands like [Deicide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deicide_(band)) and [Morbid Angel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbid_Angel).  These bands were "satanic" or had satanic overtones and maybe I thought I was an OG edge lord.  Looking back at a lot of these bands, their music doesn't hold up (with maybe the exception of Morbid Angel).  I was never big into bands that had many theatrics, maybe the exception being seeing Tool in concert.  I heard of this band or song through a podcast, possibly [Jim Florentine's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Florentine) and loved the old school metal sound of them.  I really like their newer stuff as well.  Before the pandemic I saw them in concert and it may be one of the best live concerts I have ever seen in terms of production and just how much the crowd loved them.  I miss live events and hope to see some soon.  The Rage Against the Machine concert I have tickets for has been rescheduled 3 times now and I think it's more likely for [Chinese Democracy 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Democracy) to be released before I see them in concert.

93. ["Superman's Song"](https://open.spotify.com/track/0biVEmibGXjE84BbliA23t?si=a88bcb36bcfc4cbf) Crash Test Dummies (The Ghosts That Haunt Me).  The second cd I ever bought was Crash Test Dummies - God Shuffled His Feet, but this is the song that stands out to me by them.  The reason it stands out for me is that I remember waking up one morning and my mom (and maybe also my dad?) were listening to music.  This never happened in the morning and I asked what they were listening to.  My mom said that my dad had heard a band the day before and liked them and wanted my mom to go buy their cassette tape.  This was odd as my dad never really listened to music at home and I had never heard him mention interest in a "newer" musician.

	I never really read Superman comic books so it wasn't until a few years ago that I realized that the following lyrics refer to [Solomon Grundy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomon_Grundy_(character)) 

		Superman never made any money  
		Savin' the world from Solomon Grundy

	I know it blatantly says his name in the song but I never knew what those words were until then.  

94. ["The Part of Him"](https://open.spotify.com/track/4LN6IervD3Y1gHn72Lnx1m?si=b5cc802a58d347b1) Drive-By Truckers (English Oceans).  I was trying to remember when this song came out and thought it was five or so years ago... It came out eight years ago as of this writing.  It reminds me of this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTI1WCopTsg) which talks a bit about how time seems to go quicker the older you get.  

	Going back to the song, the main riff uses a [Kay/Baxendale mandocello](https://www.gbase.com/gear/baxendale-conversion-50s-kay-mandocello-2019-sunburst) which gives it a unique twangy sound.  The part of this song that has always stood out for me was the lines:

		He was an absolute piece of shit to tell the truth  
		But he never told the truth to me
		
	Obviously, the lyrics are about a politician.  
		
95. ["The Gentle Art of Making Enemies"](https://open.spotify.com/track/2s5eB1seiy3yZqYCdQucXj?si=46338dac32d647cf) Faith No More (King For a Day, Fool For a Lifetime). The first song I heard by Faith No More was likely ["Epic"](https://open.spotify.com/track/4ReyTz0y3TGkX48wO3Llot?si=ccdad2d61f30438f) but I started listening to the band more after hearing this song.  I ended up hearing the live version of this song on a bootleg VHS of either a System of a Down concert or it was a Machine Head concert in Calgary.  The person who was kind enough to send me the concerts on VHS was the bass player from ["Breach of Trust"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breach_of_Trust_(band)) .  He ended up filling up the tape with other live stuff and one of the songs he included was a live version of Faith No More singing "The Gentle Art of Making Enemies".

	  I remember seeing the singer, Mike Patton, dressed up in a suit and wondering what the hell he was going to be doing.  The heavy riff hits in, he starts, jumping around and begins crooning the verse.  Smooth vocals but the part that caught me was:
	
		Don't you look so surprised  
		Happy birthday, fucker!

96. ["Ricky"](https://open.spotify.com/track/2QbGvQssb0VLLS4x5NOmyJ?si=8896c659187141ed) Denzel Curry (Zuu).  I really first heard Denzel Curry with his amazing cover of Rage Against the Machine's "Bulls on Parade".  You can see the video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZY4ywyFXdik)   I started listening to more of his songs and found a lot of them I really liked or they were "meh". 
      One of the songs of his that I think is catchy and a banger is "Ricky".  The podcast Song Exploder goes into great detail about this song on this [episode](https://songexploder.net/denzel-curry).   Something about the opening which sounds *off* and then it goes into that catchy beat.  It's also a short song (around 2 1/2 minutes) so it doesn't over stay its welcome.
      
  97. ["Bro Hymn (live)"](https://open.spotify.com/track/2DgZjpyv2kEB8nIl6Xp0VJ?si=8fcc0ebb7cc14b34) Pennywise (Full Circle).  This is one of the rare songs where I prefer the live version to the original version.  The [meaning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bro_Hymn) of the song gives a context of why I prefer the live version more.  There's something that gives me goosebumps when the following lyrics are sung:

			Life is the most precious thing you can lose  
			While you were here the fun was never ending  
			Laugh a minute was only the beginning  
			Jason, my brother, this one's for you
		
		Compare the studio version and the live version and you will know what I mean.

98.  ["Pony"](https://open.spotify.com/track/108U9FAOtfHOAIGdHG12Fc?si=ebf7f8fd01894e08) Far (At Night We Live).  This song came out in 2010, wayyyy after there were tons of nu-metal bands doing [this](https://loudwire.com/nu-metal-covers-popular-songs/).  This isn't to say Far are a nu-metal band (see post 71 to see another "Far" song).  This is one of those songs that is a guilty pleasure and I enjoy it more than the [original](https://open.spotify.com/track/5FR54UnizyI8pE5E9Zb0Dt?si=1265c1aba7ed42f3)   It's a ham-fisted cover that somehow ends up being a banger.  I was able to snag the single of this song on vinyl from Amazon and the [design on the vinyl](https://i.discogs.com/on-QarqyUOuKmipqJm25BM79OMtn33bIEOcZnozs9ss/rs:fit/g:sm/q:90/h:600/w:600/czM6Ly9kaXNjb2dz/LWRhdGFiYXNlLWlt/YWdlcy9SLTI1NTM5/OTAtMTM1MzI0MTY0/Ni0zMTUxLmpwZWc.jpeg) on it makes me look like I'm a [brony](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Brony).

99. [ "Down"](https://open.spotify.com/track/0HDaKOlVAfUWXdFR2RhBtN?si=212c5d36ac3f43e2) 311 (311).  I first heard of 311 after listening to Rage Against the Machine.  I'm pretty sure I heard this song on Much Music but for some reason I think it was on a commercial advertising this album.  Yes, that was a thing long before YouTube started doing it.  As their career has gone on, their music at times has become more cringy and cheesy.  That said, this album is solid from beginning to end.  They also put on a hell of a live show.  I saw them do a 30 minute set at the Warped Tour and wish they had played for longer.

100. ["The Park Avenue Sobriety Test"](https://open.spotify.com/track/2l25C8AMIiv64VzBlcbKn7?si=6c2416cd208642a0) Joel Plaskett (The Park Avenue Sobriety Test). The first song I heard by Joel Plaskett (technically, it was Joel Plaskett Emergency) was either Drunk Teenagers or Fashionable People.  This song stands out for me as I saw him on the tour supporting this album.  Even though the lyrics for this song are actually quite sad, like:

			It’s the pain in your heart, it’s the look in your eyes  
			When all of your friends are dropping like flies  
			It’s the hole in the sky when a young man dies  
			And you just want to go to sleep

		The song's melody and feel is quite happy.  I have a horrible ear so I'm unable to figure out if this song is in a major or minor key to help support my theory.  I just remember Joel Plaskett playing this live and smiling his ass off the entire time while playing it.  That's true love of your art.  

101. ["Cut Your Ribbon"](https://open.spotify.com/track/1DYud4lcStjYxJ8JBBva6g?si=7f489bf5a8f54ba1) Sparta (Wiretap Scars).  I previously mentioned that I bought this album and The Mars Volta's [De-Loused in the Comatorium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De-Loused_in_the_Comatorium) at the same time and initially this was the album I liked more.  This song, which is both the first single and track on the album, has a catchy guitar riff in 6/8 time (I actually thought it was in 3/4 time and looked it up but I'm surprised I was that close to guessing the time signature correctly).  The drums at the beginning, the somewhat clean guitar riff and then *BAM* almost the same guitar riff as before but with distortion.  It's amazing how much the dynamics of the song change with some distortion.

102. ["No Vaseline"](https://open.spotify.com/track/4wEbikMfcSFAukCbbL06si?si=23c64ffd22f44434) Ice Cube (Death Certificate).  I find "diss" songs are either meh, okay or vicious.  This song is the latter of those.  The only other song I find that may be as vicious as this song is Eminem's ["The Warning"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ro-NdIc0u3w) but even then, "No Vaseline" is attacking a bunch of people.  Even the title, "No Vaseline", is referring to anal rape without lubricant.  Rather then explain what the song is about, read the Wikipedia [article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Vaseline) about it.  If you have an interest in early 90s rap, specifically about NWA, the [lyrics on Genius.com](https://genius.com/Ice-cube-no-vaseline-lyrics) provide a lot of details about what was happening around this time.   

			Tried to diss Ice Cube, it wasn't worth it
			'Cause the broomstick fit your ass so perfect
			Cut my hair? Nah, cut them balls
			'Cause I heard you like giving up the drawers

		Absolutely ruthless.

103. ["One"](https://open.spotify.com/track/0LAcM6I7ijW4VVW0aytl1t?si=99972f83eab14905) Metallica (...And Justice for All).  I never was a fan of Metallica until the later years of high school.  The reason for this was probably from this [Beavis and Butthead](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z08JxZDBYWw) clip.  The Cowardly Lion reference still makes me laugh my ass off.  I had listened to Metallica but mostly stuff from the Black Album, Load and Reload.  Looking back on it now, I don't mind it as much but at the time I wasn't a fan.  In high school I finally heard "One" and it is definitely an epic metal song.  By epic, I don't mean the hipster way of saying something is "epic" but in the literal definition.  Everything from the opening guitar solo to the ending are amazing.  I would also argue that the guitar riffs during the breakdown are heavier than 99% of the breakdowns in hardcore songs.  Also, how can James Hetfield down pick so quick?!  

104. ["Long Time Running"](https://open.spotify.com/track/7C6QeMxWgaPK68MFmlgO0X?si=b3d5354310c1418d) The Tragically Hip (Road Apples).  This is a memorable song, but not for the happiest of reasons.  A few years ago a friend of mine passed away somewhat suddenly.  She was a huge fan of The Tragically Hip (or as she and many other Canadians would say, "The Hip").  I was familiar with many of the more popular songs by The Tragically Hip (so mostly the songs they released as singles).  I hadn't heard of this song until her funeral.  At her funeral this song played while a slideshow of photos from her life played.  It's a great song but it's also a sad song.  It's one of those songs where I can smile when I hear it and the next time have tears in my eyes.  The word brave is thrown around too often now but watching Gord Downie during the Tragically Hip's last performance is the definition of it.  Heartwarming and breaking at the same time.  

105. ["City of Lakes"](https://open.spotify.com/track/169DGnAdbmSFJM0CDUh7iB?si=410d2bd6a33f462a) Matt Mays (Matt Mays).  My friend Dave introduced me to Matt Mays as saying they are a more modern version of [Blue Rodeo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Rodeo).  The first tracks on this album definitely have that vibe and this song is a more rocky version of some Blue Rodeo tracks.  Along with Neil Young's "[Rockin' in the Free World](https://open.spotify.com/track/1gp5GlIHJysAgiOGbhoRS1?si=8902791901fc4318)".  The opening lyrics remind me of being on a bender and waking up some place not knowing where you are or what happened.  

				This pavement feels cold on my face  
				And my bones have seen better days  
				Be a friend, pick me up off the ground
				
		It reminds me of my youth that I miss.
	
	
106.   ["Black Me Out"](https://open.spotify.com/track/6XI33hctgDLUIRKI8wsJS4?si=a0d469b501154542) Against Me! (Transgender Dysphoria Blues).  Some albums remind me of a time and place I listened to them.  For this album, it reminds me of walking around [Keflavik, Iceland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keflav%C3%ADk).  I visited Iceland and ended up in this small town for a few days so I just walked around for a couple of hours each day.  This album was recommended to me and I downloaded it before my trip.  I would play this album on repeat while walking around the city and the area around it.  A short album (under 30 minutes), I was reminded of it the other day when reading an article about the "Top 10 Concept Albums of the 2000s".  I never before thought of this album as a concept album but it does make sense.  It's a solid album all the way through but the opening riff and the opening lyrics are just filled with visceral anger:
				
				I don't ever want to talk that way again  
				I don't want to know people like that anymore  
				As if there was an obligation  
				As if I owed you something

		This is probably the only verse in the song that doesn't have profanity in it either.  The choice of this song to close the album was a great decision as it ties the entire album together.

107. ["Formed a Band"](https://open.spotify.com/track/6BMhrvODuuB1KasGoSM5S2?si=3b4308230bef4e89) Art Brut (Bang Bang Rock and Roll).  If anyone argues that video games aren't relevant in today's culture then I would argue that I probably wouldn't have heard of this band if it weren't for [FIFA Street 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_Street_2).  This song is a song that people either love or hate.  I can understand both sides.  It has a very repetitive chorus and the singer has a voice that is somewhat monotone.  That said, this song is catchy as hell and whenever I hear it I think of FIFA Street 2 for XBox.    

108. ["Ghetto Blasta"](https://open.spotify.com/track/4gWLC8Lym2LAsJjguihzS9?si=1bfe4fb8fe764ea5) 2 Black 2 Strong (Doin' Hard Time on Planet Earth).  I haven't listened to this song (or album in a long time).  I had my music on shuffle today and this song came on.  The intro is the same intro from House of Pain's ["Jump Around"](https://open.spotify.com/track/6JymsaWDHk2Yj4e0yNBIFH?si=717f2eea14554974) but sped up.  I was curious to see which album was released first and this album was.  This album could probably be considered a mixture between Public Enemy and NWA.  While looking up this album I just saw that Chuck D has a verse on one of the songs on this album.  I found this album on CD at a pawn shop I frequented in high school.  The pawn shop had a bin of CDs (often scratched CDs, CDs without cases or CDs from less popular artists).  These CDs were a $1 each and it seemed like they were updated once a week.  Everyone Monday I had a spare after my first class in high school and a few friends and I would go down there and I would buy some albums.  This song reminds me of that time.  
  
109. ["Fyrsta"](https://open.spotify.com/track/1EEJBUOORu9dLZQSeQkZOP) Ólafur Arnalds (Living Room Songs).  I'm generally not a fan of classical music and if you would ask me the difference between classical and neo-classical I would say that neo-classical is [Yngwie Malmsteen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yngwie_Malmsteen)  For awhile I had a tendency to go to Amazon daily and look for the records that were the daily deal or that were under $20.  This album came up and I had heard of Ólafur Arnalds but had never listened to him.  I listened to a few minutes of this album on YouTube and bought it as for awhile I was listening to ambient, classical or jazz (basically any music without vocals) while I was doing work from home (COVID times...).  This song has a haunting sad feeling to it but what stands out for me is that how this song is an album opener. The beginning of the song sounds like Ólafur sitting down at the piano and you can hear it in the music.  You can literally hear the room ambience in this playing and it sounds like you are in the room with him.

110. ["Lotus"](https://open.spotify.com/track/0EX99kuSsTM9RyRAciMvvE?si=10c9a83ddd714ec8) REM (Up).  For awhile I would buy albums without really knowing any of the songs on them.  I don't recall if I bought this album new or second-hand but regardless, I would often just buy albums randomly.  This was during the time that I was downloading music on a 56.6 connection and would hope that someone wouldn't lift the phone otherwise I would get disconnected from the internet.   I bought this album and wasn't the biggest fan of it but this song stood out for me.  Just something with the chorus being multilayered and the words 

				  So happy to show us  
				  Oh, I ate the lotus  
			      Say, haven't you noticed?  
		          Oh, I ate the lotus

I'm not saying it's non-sensical but I have no idea what it means and I'm fine with that.

111. ["You Think I Ain't Worth a Dollar, But I Feel Like a Millionaire"](https://open.spotify.com/track/68DKrU7sTyDpDA5T3dsOlk?si=66382b82b62641f6) Queens of the Stone Age (Songs for the Deaf).  I can remember where I heard this song for the first time.  I bought this album based on the song ["No One Knows"](https://open.spotify.com/track/6NvRxjfYkkT2SpirAlmsjH?si=7fb652fb78534ba1) during a lunch break at college.  Most of my classes were in a computer lab so I brought headphones with me so I could listen to CDs when doing assignments on computer.  The beginning of this song after the radio intro is quite quiet and back in the mix.  I turned up the volume and at the 1:00 minute mark [Nick Oliveri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Oliveri) screams and the music gets LOUD.  It scared the hell out of me the first time and I remember jumping up.  A few of my friends in class noticed that this happened to me and started laughing their asses off.  Regardless of that, this song is a banger and besides ["No One Knows"](https://open.spotify.com/track/6NvRxjfYkkT2SpirAlmsjH?si=7fb652fb78534ba1) it is my favourite song on the album.

112. ["Cantaloop (Flip Fantasia)"](https://open.spotify.com/track/2AnTuxahfcAS7dGxGZnihY?si=be390b85ae9e4754) Us3 (Hand on the Torch).  This song was on a MTV compilation album called ["Buzz Bin"](https://www.discogs.com/release/982146-Various-MTV-Buzz-Bin-Volume-1) that my sister bought for me for my birthday.  Looking at the track list now, it still holds up.  There's not a song on this album that I don't like (and don't go hipster on me saying "Creep" by Radiohead is god awful).  This song is catchy as hell and until I [looked it up](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantaloop_(Flip_Fantasia)) a few years ago I would never guessed that it sampled a Herbie Hancock song.  I remember as a teenager playing the compilation album this was on while playing [NCAA Basketball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Basketball_(video_game)) for SNES.  Whenever this song comes up I always think about playing that game to this.  It just has a silky feel to it that reminds me of basketball. 

113. ["Lost in the Supermarket"](https://open.spotify.com/track/72boGlgSwUK01n44O2tOCv?si=ae9958a45e8643c2) The Clash (London Calling).  I had heard of The Clash before hearing this song but the first time I heard of this song was in a magazine called [Blender](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blender_(magazine)) (it was a music magazine by the same people who created [Maxim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxim_(magazine)) magazine).  They printed song lyrics on the spine of each issue and one issue had the following lyrics for this song:

			I wasn't born so much as I fell out  
			Nobody seemed to notice me

This issue came out shortly after [Joe Strummer's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Strummer) death.  

114. ["Juice"](https://open.spotify.com/track/0k664IuFwVP557Gnx7RhIl?si=e9b681e6fc774b45) Lizzo (Cuz I Love You).  Once again this is a song that based on everything I listen to I should hate.  There's something about this song where it has a classic 80s dance vibe to it and a catchy bass line that makes me like it (not enough to shake my ass to it, I don't dance).  I'm not a fan of the video (and that's not me fat-shaming, it's just too cheesy).  I was a fan of this entire album and actually have pre-ordered Lizzo's next album (on vinyl as I'm a hipster).

115.  ["Simple Man"](https://open.spotify.com/track/1ju7EsSGvRybSNEsRvc7qY?si=68b6247a1aa14587) Lynyrd Skynyrd (Pronounced 'Lĕh-'nérd 'Skin-'nérd').  It would have been easy to pick "Sweet Home Alabama" or "Free Bird" as I also like those songs but in my opinion "Simple Man" is better than those two songs.  I never knew it was from Lynyrd Skynrd's debut album until today and also just learned that "Free Bird", "Tuesday's Gone" and "Gimme Three Steps" are also from their debut album.  You can say what you want about their "the South will rise again" redneck views, they sure knew how to write hits.  The intro with its arpeggiated chords and smooth bass line make this a favourite of mine.  As I previously mentioned, I'm not a fan of the rebel South crap (Patterson Hood from the Drive-By Truckers wrote a great article about ["The South's Heritage is More than A Flag"](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/09/magazine/the-souths-heritage-is-so-much-more-than-a-flag.html) ).  This song luckily doesn't talk about the rebel  stuff but instead is someone reflecting on their life.  The great thing about songs like this are that they are still timeless almost 50 years later.

116.  ["Interstate Love Song"](https://open.spotify.com/track/6qLEOZvf5gI7kWE63JE7p3?si=ec4a8e1704ad4a76) Stone Temple Pilots (Purple).  This song has an intro which lulls you into what seems like a laid back groove but then goes into a full-on rock song.  I remember hearing this song on a local radio station when it came out and it played almost every night at 9:00 PM.  This was before YouTube and if you didn't own the album you would listen to it on the radio or MuchMusic (Canada's equivalent of MTV).  It is a catchy rock/pop song but one of the things that I now notice listening to it (and other Stone Temple Pilots songs) is that the guitarist uses chords and chord progressions that aren't conventionally used in pop music.  This song is an example of it and maybe that's why I am fan of it.  

117. ["the ground below (feat. Royal Blood)"](https://open.spotify.com/track/0ZihFuThMaeARjmxTsoNFe?si=b519542ad46e452a) Run the Jewels (Royal Jewels Mix).  I have been to quite a few concerts but have never been to a hip hop or dance music concert (I'm fine with the latter as I don't dance but I do love the atmosphere you see at hip hop concerts).  This song is an absolute head banger and it's based around a sample of ["Ether" by the Gang of Four](https://www.whosampled.com/sample/753119/Run-the-Jewels-The-Ground-Below-Gang-of-Four-Ether/).  I didn't know of the song "Ether" before this came out so I'm not going to try and be a hipster.  Normally, I'm not a fan of remixes of songs but there must be something with adding heavy guitars and drums to a rap song that I like (another example is [House of Pain's "Shamrock and Shenanigans - Butch Vig Mix"](https://open.spotify.com/track/0R9nZ90oZt6f2h2BPCln3Y?si=9b48c7b5d6d04749)).  This song has that vibe and I'm hoping I finally get to see them in concert with Rage Against the Machine (it has been rescheduled 2-3 times because of COVID).       

118. ["Wilma's Rainbow"](https://open.spotify.com/track/3QKloANAAhqsgRXAuBioYv?si=fdf706f8f53d4a4c) Helmet (Betty).  I first heard this song on a compilation album titled ["Bored Generation"](https://www.discogs.com/release/763290-Various-Bored-Generation).  There are many different artists on it: Pennywise, NOFX, Primus, Rancid, etc... but the reason I bought this album was this album had multimedia aspects to it when you put it into your computer (mostly just skating, snowboarding and wakeboarding videos if I remember correctly).  Of course I bought it and the computer I had at the time wasn't good enough to run the application that had these videos on it so I had to explore the directory structure of the CD, find the Quicktime .MOV files and load them up manually.  In the mid to late 90s CDs often would have some extra stuff on the disc and if you put them into your computer you could access this stuff.  Once ripping CD to mp3s became easier for people to do, some companies did stuff to counter this and ended up installing rootkits: for example the [Sony BMG copy protection rootkit scandal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_BMG_copy_protection_rootkit_scandal) (looking this up, I was surprised this happened in 2005 as I thought it happened much earlier).  Anyways, this song or any of the other songs on the "Bored Generation" album remind me of the interactive components you sometimes got when you bought a CD.  This song is also great but I always wondered if the titular Wilma is the Wilma from ["The Flintstones"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Flintstones). 

119. ["Du Hast"](https://open.spotify.com/track/6uEvFCaOqXyEidoO8BZbyh?si=95fa006986094757) Rammstein (Sehnsucht).  When this song came out it was before Rammstein were on MuchMusic.  I heard of them through mp3 trading on [IRC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat) so I guess I was the original Internet hipster.  I actually just had to check on YouTube to see if there is a music video for this song [(and there is)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3q8Od5qJio).  This song was *scary* at first in the same way that [Marilyn Manson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marilyn_Manson) was scary.  All the rumours about them (ex. are they Nazis, what do the lyrics mean) eventually were dismissed once anyone used the internet or a bit of common sense.  Regardless, this song still hits heavy today and that main guitar riff is heavy as hell.  I watched a few videos of them performing this song live before writing this up and it still gives me goose bumps. 

120. ["(Sittin' On) the Dock of the Bay"](https://open.spotify.com/track/3zBhihYUHBmGd2bcQIobrF?si=445623fea9f54bc7) Otis Redding (The Dock of the Bay).  This is a song that features two things that normally I hate: the sounds of waves in it (sound effects) and whistling.  The bassline that drives this song is catchy and Otis Redding has an amazing voice.  I just looked up who played bass on this song and it's [Donald “Duck” Dunn](https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/inside-otis-reddings-final-masterpiece-sittin-on-the-dock-of-the-bay-122170/)  who ["played on virtually every classic '60s Stax soul recording"](https://www.allmusic.com/artist/donald-duck-dunn-mn0000180850/credits?1660865420184).  It's just a classic song and I am ashamed to admit that the first time I heard I was in my early 20s and it was on a soul compilation album.    

121. ["Two"](https://open.spotify.com/track/4Yg9sKLmvYuybzU9Ruiced?si=36a225983b2a4755) Ryan Adams (Easy Tiger).  Of course the first joke everyone makes when they hear Ryan Adams is the Bryan Adams joke (I'm guilty of it myself).  This isn't the first song I heard by him but it is probably one of my favourite songs by him (along with ["Dirty Rain"](https://open.spotify.com/track/3XVLfJbADi7F1p5Rh1UTGw?si=e40bdb9a6adc4536)).  I don't remember where I first heard this song by the following lyrics about addiction stand out to me:    

			I'm fractured from the fall  
			And I wanna go home  
			But it takes two when it used to take one  
			It takes two when it used to take only one

Somewhat ironically I remember hearing this song one winter in a grocery store [Superstore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Canadian_Superstore)whenever I was in the pharmacy section.

122. ["Random Rules"](https://open.spotify.com/track/6lquLzGE5CRoq2htyr2QGS?si=bb1925ae35424589) Silver Jews (American Water).  Unfortunately, I never heard of this band until after singer [David Berman's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Berman_(musician)) death.  I find their music somewhat similar to [The Eels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eels_(band)) in that the lyrics are often sarcastic and the singing is quite monotone.  While speaking about The Eels, singer [Mark Oliver Everett's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Oliver_Everett) autobiography ["Things the Grandchildren Should Know"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Things_the_Grandchildren_Should_Know) is an amazing book and a must read.  This song has a somewhat dark tone to in terms of lyrics but the horns make it seem happy.  This creates a juxtaposition which stands out with Berman's fairly monotone, but sharp, lyrics.  The lines that I heard the first time listening to this song that still give me goose bumps when I even hear them now are:

			So if you don't want me I promise not to linger  
			But before I go I gotta ask you dear about the tan line on your ring finger

123. ["Million Rappers"](https://open.spotify.com/track/5NzwhGEGWhAnydguzNzo8I?si=1a8afc6215934db9) Phunk Junkeez (Fear of a Whack Planet).  Looking this song up on Spotify I see that it only has 12,000 plays.  Wow, this surprises me as I thought this band was more popular.  I heard of this band through a 311 song where they name drop the Phunk Junkeez.  I bought this album at a local pawn shop and... I wasn't that impressed with the album but I liked this song.  I bought the album in high school and remember driving around at lunch hour listening to it.  Of course my car didn't have a cd player so it was hooked up to a portable CD player that had a tape player adapter so I could listen to it in my car.  I just remember a certain part of the song cracked me and my friends up while driving and it was: 

			No clowning around, just rockin' the spot  
			And pay attention to the 12 inch cut  
			Cuz DJ Roachclip's rippin' it up

124. ["Easy Ride"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo-HhAeGml8) Relatively Clean Rivers (Relatively Clean Rivers).  This is a song that I forgot about.  It randomly came up when I was listening to my music shuffled.  I don't remember where I heard about this band.  It may have been through listening to the ["Drive-By Truckers"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drive-By_Truckers) or it being promoted on [OiNK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oink%27s_Pink_Palace).   I don't have the lyrics memorized but I remember the song and where I often was when I listened to it.  When I was attending university I had a cheap mp3 player.  It was the type that took AA batteries and I remember buying tons of rechargeable batteries as they didn't last long.  The mp3 player would always play the first song in alphabetical order when the batteries were replaced and this was the song.  I remember walking to my university classes listening to this song a few times a week.

125. ["Wait and Bleed"](https://open.spotify.com/track/2gscB6kDOmrv1P6qs2KXE3?si=b265adb88cd14acc) Slipknot (Slipknot).  I remember buying this album with a gift card I was given at Christmas for working at A&W.  A mutual friend of a friend (who later became a friend) suggested this album to me and I suggested System of a Down's self-titled.  While I probably liked ["Spit It Out"](https://open.spotify.com/track/2W2eaLVKv9NObcLXlYRZZo?si=79f92618e24b47d8) more initially (the nu-metal style to it is probably why), this song is probably my favourite on the album.  I went to a Catholic high school where a band performed Slipknot covers at a pep rally.  When they were asked what songs they were going to perform they said Bruce Springsteen covers.  Needless to say, there weren't any bands performing at pep rallies for the next year and a half I was there.

126. ["I've Seen Footage"]((https://open.spotify.com/track/7nCONy10IHp7XD3oYZ0lcx?si=03e6cafd30b94ed5) Death Grips (The Money Store).  I have no clue where I first heard of Death Grips and they are definitely a band where people will either like them or hate them.  I normally have no issue recommending bands or songs to people but this is a band where I am yet to recommend them to someone and that person like them.  I swear this song samples Salt-N-Pepa's ["Push It"](https://open.spotify.com/track/6sT9MWlJManry3EQwf4V80?si=34c132d6f9004fb3) at the 7 second mark but still haven't had it confirmed.  Even though I wouldn't understand the lyrics without looking at them in front of me, there's definitely an aggressive nature to this song that gets me every time.  

127. ["Can I Kick It?"](https://open.spotify.com/track/3Ti0GdlrotgwsAVBBugv0I?si=8c29ff9fb6104ff4) A Tribe Called Quest (People's Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm).  I picked this song for a few reasons but probably the biggest reason is that I didn't want to include another Lou Reed song on this list (not yet anyways).  The main sample from this song is the bassline from Lou Reed's ["Walk on the Wild Side"](https://open.spotify.com/track/5p3JunprHCxClJjOmcLV8G?si=c7de274516f24c8c) and I absolutely love the bass line.  My first time hearing Q-tip from a Tribe Called Quest was him on the Beastie Boys' ["Get It Together"](https://open.spotify.com/track/6aaPceG6TnixvAZQ1wBMdp?si=2f50d97906784333).  He has a laid back rap style that makes him stand out when rapping with the Beastie Boys.  Q-tip's laid back rap style perfectly suits the sample of "Can I Kick It?" which is why I love this song.

128. ["Ball and Chain"](https://open.spotify.com/track/4CsTkNvkwQLel6sxQqrXSj?si=a1ae5b40e23145f3) Social Distortion (Social Distortion). Some songs bring you back to a place and time you were at and this song does this for me.  I had recently got dumped and was living away from home for university.  The beginning lyrics of the song stood out for me as I was in a state of depression thinking that nothing will ever be the same (and technically I wasn't as it was a life changing event).

			Well it's been ten years, and a thousand tears  
			And look at the mess I'm in  
			A broken nose and a broken heart,  
			An empty bottle of gin

I must have played this song on repeat for a few days on end and bawled my eyes out while the song played.  My apologies to my old roommates and I want to say thanks to them for not telling me to quit playing this song over and over. 

129. ["Turn Your Back"](https://open.spotify.com/track/7AK0d1Qp3XAxFwM9GRIDER?si=5049ceed2d804910) Billy Talent (Billy Talent III).  Although I included the album track for this song, I actually prefer the [version with Anti-Flag](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-zPPi_QB8A).  I'm normally not a huge fan of Anti-Flag but this song is better with them.  There's something about Billy Talent that stands out to me from other bands that are of a similar genre; the unique chords used by guitarist Ian D'sa.  In a way it reminds me of Dillinger Escape Plan in that the chords aren't something you typically hear in this type of music.  

130.  ["Times Like These"](https://open.spotify.com/track/4WM22pqXRZkcdrp7alhjsv?si=5621aa872c6f4ab9) Jack Johnson (On and On).  I was never a big fan of Jack Johnson but do love a few of his songs; this being one of them.   It's a fairly laid back song and as much as Jack Johnson became one of those "surfer guys who play acoustic guitar", this has a chill vibe to it.  I also for some reason like the percussive way he plays guitar with the muted string rakes and how it intertwines with the hand drums.  Maybe I just want to be a surfer and am jealous of him?

131.  ["So Far So Good"](https://open.spotify.com/track/0jPlnAW9OJhs0bks5Sh58U?si=04648bcaed3941a4) Thornley (Come Clean).  Even though I had listened to [Big Wreck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Wreck)  before (Ian Thornley's former band), I wasn't too familiar with any of their stuff besides the singles.  A friend of mine told me he had worked on this (or was working on this album, I don't remember the time line).  I checked it out and was hooked.  The guitars sound heavy as hell but still melodic.  This song is a perfect example of the combination.  I saw them in concert a year or so after this album came out and remember them playing a certain song (it may have been ["Easy Comes"](https://open.spotify.com/track/2PFSj63RDdevENGRYQ0tMo?si=feff35302d134531] from this album).  They started the song up and they blew a breaker or the power went.  Waited a few minutes... tried playing the song again and the same thing happened.  This may have happened another time or not, but you could tell that Ian was visibly frustrated.  This is an album that I come back to every once in awhile and it still holds up. 

132. ["Engine No. 9"](https://open.spotify.com/track/5vVKkF3xih38Vcoo4HgAo8?si=ab8cce83f3e94e2e) Deftones (Adrenaline).  A lot of people criticize this album saying its very aggressive and immature (it is the Deftones first album) but this album is one of my favourite albums by them.  Sure, it does sound like nu-metal albums from around that time but it has some bangers on it.  This song has a basic riff on it but in the intro when its just a guitar playing a single note riff and then Chino screams... it hits you like a hammer.   In the past decade I haven't watched a lot of movies in theatre (maybe 4-5 movies) but can remember seeing ["Law Abiding Citizen"](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1197624/) in theatre.  This song is in the movie and when it appeared, it gave me goosebumps.  That's what all good music should do.

133. ["This Present Darkness"](https://open.spotify.com/track/58QjrIioqb5JC1dwYLfC5U?si=92a3e75088094ce3) Chimaira (This Present Darkness).  This was another band that I found out via the Internet in 2000.  I did Street Team/Promo stuff for System of a Down (does anyone know what happened to Streetwise Marketing and Promotion...?).  I somehow found out about Chimaira and did Street Team stuff for them as well (hanging up posters, giving out cassette samplers, stickers, etc...).  I remember getting a nice shirt from the band along with the promotional goods.  This entire album is extremely heavy and I was a huge fan of it.  I was also a knucklehead and thought that the band's name was pronounced "Chim-er-a" not "Kim-er-a".  Apparently I suck at [ancient Greek mythology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chimera_(mythology).  This song has the palm muted "chugga chugga" metal rhythm I love so much but have never been able to play at all.  I remember the band appearing on [Farm Club](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ii5inm6CXhE) and that night I chatted with the singer, Mark Hunter, on ICQ for a few minutes.  He seemed confused that I said I just saw the band on Farm Club as it appeared a few months earlier.  I later realized the reason for the confusion was that the show was airing in Canada, a few months after the initial airing on Farm Club. 

134. ["Hip Hop is Dead"](https://open.spotify.com/track/7iF9B5dbSOfEeznArGFHhn?si=b2056ecc6d3f4ce1) Nas (Hip Hop is Dead).  This is a song that the original version is different from the album version.  It changed after Jam Master Jay of Run DMC was [murdered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jam_Master_Jay#Death).   This song is based around a sample of The Incredible Bongo Band's cover of Iron Butterfly's ["In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida"](https://open.spotify.com/track/1exUq8aG2OMbSeZeTwz06k?si=e81bc0d8826e48f4).  It seems like such an obvious song to sample and according to WhoSampled.com [many artists](https://www.whosampled.com/Iron-Butterfly/In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida/sampled/) thought the same thing.  I actually didn't know that the sample used on this song was a cover until now.  There's something about this beat that makes it perfect for a rap song.

135. ["Mr. Brownstone"](https://open.spotify.com/track/65G4Ib3w7tgLjUkO5GseN0?si=c42f40aec20d4b2e) Guns N' Roses (Appetite For Destruction).  I am not a huge fan of Guns N' Roses but this is one of their songs I really like (maybe because it isn't overplayed like their other singles).  The opening with the strumming of muted guitar strings and a flanger (or maybe a chorus) and the drum fill on the toms kicks off the riff.  It's a fairly simple guitar riff but the fact the guitars and bass are tuned down a 1/2 step makes it sound thicker.  I also normally don't like Axl's vocals but his vocals fit this song.  It sounds grimy, which I like.

136. ["Keep It Between the Lines"](https://open.spotify.com/track/3JWJiLDqawZtilIo7p0rJ9?si=722fd36c7fc14706) Sturgill Simpson (A Sailor's Guide to Earth).  I just got this album on vinyl today and forgot how great of a song this is.  I saw Sturgill Simpson live the same summer I saw Jason Isbell and both were great performances.  The thing that sticks out for me in the song is the horn section.  Not enough rock music has horns (with maybe the exception of some Bruce Springsteen).  

137. ["Vehicle"](https://open.spotify.com/track/6hnyQ0YpiO35rutiLLHLmr?si=a8766f715c414e57) The Ides of March (Vehicle).  This is a new old song I've been listening to.  I have been going through [Stereo Gum The Number Ones'](https://www.stereogum.com/category/the-number-ones/) and found out about this song when reading about Survivor's [Eye of the Tiger](https://open.spotify.com/track/2HHtWyy5CgaQbC7XSoOb0e?si=08ecedfde0d64456).  The guitarist for Survivor is the singer in this song.  Maybe my previous post influenced something as here is another rock song with horns in it and it's funky as all heck.

138. ["MMMBop"](https://open.spotify.com/track/0lnxrQAd9ZxbhBBe7d8FO8?si=deee931e589b4559) Hanson (Middle of Nowhere).  There are songs as a youth that I hated just to be a contrarian.  I didn't know if I liked them or not; they just were popular and I had to not like them because of this.  As I got older I mellowed out a bit and started listening to some of the songs I "hated".  Don't get me wrong, most of them I still hate.  However, this is a song that I've learned to like.  It reminds me of a time when I would go with some friends and stay with a friend who lived in Calgary.  He would go to bed early and the rest of us would stay up later, drinking and playing [Hot Shots Golf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everybody%27s_Golf) or watching awful movies like ["Freddie Got Fingered"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everybody%27s_Golf).  My friend who went to bed early would wake up early and while the rest of us were half asleep/hung over, he would crank this song on repeat on his CD player.  I hated it at first, but it is a damn catchy song. 

139. ["Eternal Life"](https://open.spotify.com/track/7bf4nfz09yp6w7L7r9hQ1V?si=a54fb71881734a43) Jeff Buckley (Grace).  Not to be a hipster but the first song I can remember hearing by Jeff Buckley is this song and not [Hallelujah](https://open.spotify.com/track/3pRaLNL3b8x5uBOcsgvdqM?si=592c700434d546e8).  This song has the off-sounding riff at the beginning of the song and then it hits you with that big riff at 20ish seconds into it.  The riff of this song reminds me of something Soundgarden or Stone Temple Pilots would write.  And Jeff Buckley's voice... wow.  In my opinion, this song is different than most on the album as it's heavier.  Jeff Buckley was able to write and sing beautiful songs and heavy songs as well.

140. ["Keep Me in Your Heart"](https://open.spotify.com/track/1zSzJAosfqJugLx7mZl5xt?si=2aa1314ab22b4f72) Warren Zevon (The Wind).  I'll preface this song by saying I'm a casual Warren Zevon song (meaning I first heard of him through ["Werewolves of London"](https://open.spotify.com/track/6kotXaSQaGYxE62hVpdHWu?si=fdad4d27e1164820) and I don't hate the song).  I watched a documentary a few years ago about Zevon and it had this song in it.  The documentary was on Vh1 and was [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnQFAqRfT4A).  The song is at 40:20 of the video.  This album was Zevon's last album as he was diagnosed with terminal cancer and this apparently was the last song recorded on the album.  Rather then reiterate the history behind this song I'll just post this [link](https://warrenzevon.fandom.com/wiki/Keep_Me_in_Your_Heart).  

		Note: I just found out the Vh1 documentary I posted above is called [Warren Zevon: Keep Me in Your Heart](https://warrenzevon.fandom.com/wiki/Warren_Zevon:_Keep_Me_In_Your_Heart)  

141. ["Hell's Winter"](https://open.spotify.com/track/498IVFBNw4IZL8E9MTDM6j?si=bc312ccdfdc14e7b) Cage (Hell's Winter).  I either first heard of Cage through a free leech on a *cough* music "sharing" site *cough* or a song of his that was on [The Wire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wire) (which is a must see TV series).  His [early life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cage_(rapper)#Early_life) is jaw dropping and this song seems a bit autobiographical.  Rather then just quote lyrics from this song, just listen to it.   

142. ["Fantasy (feat. O.D.B.)"](https://open.spotify.com/track/2itAOPLerxnnc8KXHMqPWu?si=a8968b533c184f3c) Mariah Carey ft. Ol' Dirty Bastard (The Remixes).  First off, I like this song for ODB but I can't deny that Mariah Carey has an amazing voice.  This, juxtaposed to ODB's voice, shouldn't work.  But it does.  If you look online you can find an acapella version of this song (with both artists' vocals).  At the 3:00 minute mark ODB comes in solo and for some reason it should be jarring but it isn't.  I honestly can't think of a Mariah Carey song I tolerate (and maybe that's because I watched her movie [Glitter](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118589/) which is awful.     

143. ["Runaway Train"](https://open.spotify.com/track/3TW48DvQ7ChwY1Yy1tkMaP?si=13994aaf04264e42) Soul Asylum (Grave Dancer's Union).  Looking back at my list of songs, I'm surprised I didn't have this earlier.   This song's [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRtvqT_wMeY) is quite moving and apparently a lot of children were found because of it.  It has an amazingly catchy chorus and whenever I hear the song I have to hum along to it.  I was also such an odd kid as I remember seeing David Pirner (the lead singer of Soul Asylum) wearing a Spaghetti O's t-shirt at an award's show and asking my mom to get me one of those shirts.  As I am wondering if this is something that actually happened or if my memory is weird, I found the [picture of him wearing it at the MTV Video Awards](https://i.pinimg.com/474x/45/5e/c3/455ec364c8a47f965c46568249bb60b8--soul-asylum-spagetti.jpg).
