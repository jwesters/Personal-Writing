My friend, Jeff, shared with me something that him and his family are doing.  They are each creating a list of 25 songs that stood out to them in their lifetime.  The songs don't necessarily have to be your favourite songs, just something that reminds you of a certain moment or event in your life.  He shared his list with me and it interested me in doing the same.  I'm going to write a brief synopsis of why I included a song, if only to vindicate myself for some of my choices.    

Here is a Spotify list of my Top 25 songs (I didn't include my most hated song for obvious reasons):  [Top 25 Songs](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7M4NsmgufRctzVp6rsXRwA?si=51eb80b2809240fc)  


1. ["She Drives Me Crazy"](https://open.spotify.com/track/4d6eqRtpDX7tydHJGDZUBQ?si=UneSuYd9RIGg9urZuEBqyw) - Fine Young Cannibals (The Raw & the Cooked). This is a weird pick for my first song as I've never owned the album.  It's my first memory of buying music (it was a birthday or Christmas gift for my Dad and my mom paid for it).  It was also a vinyl record.  [Roland Gift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roland_Gift) has an amazing voice and heavily processed guitar riff is classic late 80s.  This song also reminds me of a tv commercial they had for the show ["Who's the Boss?"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlPiFKEGcZU) where it showed clips of Angela, trying to look sexy, interspliced with Tony ogling her.  Useless Fact - There is a British spinoff of "Who's the Boss?" called ["The Upper Hand"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4weI7biThFA).  It somehow finds a way to be even worse than its American counterpart.    

2.  ["Someday"](https://open.spotify.com/track/0Sfxy4ROJxdTK92CIQqcDJ?si=VJzMHXkxQGOMEzR4xTNvGw) - Zebrahead (Waste of Mind). "Late out the door \ Grab my clothes off the floor \ Backpack and books \ 'Cause school is a chore".  I love the guitar riff on this one, even though the song now sounds dated.   It reminds me of high school.  The band had two vocalists (a rapper and a singer) which was somewhat unique at the time (311 and Phunk Junkeez are the only other bands I can think of that did this at the time and this predates Linkin Park by a couple of years).

3. ["1/1"](https://open.spotify.com/track/3bCmDqflFBHijgJfvtqev5?si=95bYSXB-TiqMzxM2uboKjA) - Brian Eno (Ambient 1: Music for Airports).  From Wikipedia - "Music for Airports employs the phasing of tape loops of different lengths. For example, in "1/1", a single piano melody is repeated and at different times other instruments will fade in and out to create a complex, evolving pattern as the sounds fall in and out of sync with each other.".  17 minutes of a mellow repeating piece of music that slightly changes throughout.  I'm not sure if this album was my first exposure to Brian Eno's ambient music (it might have been ["Discreet Music"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discreet_Music).  It's just something simple but beautiful at the same time.  Which leads me to my next song...

4. ["dlp 1.1"](https://open.spotify.com/track/31FiS1jMI38kYfC8ey358W?si=bT_TOoqVRHWli-dvqvg-2w) - William Basinski (The Disintegration Loops).  Similar to the previous selection ("1/1" by Brian Eno) as it is 60 minutes of looping tape.  However, some differences in the piece.  From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Disintegration_Loops#Recording) - "In the 1980s, Basinski recorded from found sound sources, shortwave radio, and delay systems, influenced by musicians such as Steve Reich and Brian Eno.  Decades later, while transferring the recordings from magnetic tape to a more reliable digital format, Basinski found that the tape had deteriorated sufficiently that as it passed the tape head, the ferrite detached from the plastic backing and fell off. He allowed the loops to play for extended periods as they deteriorated further, with increasing gaps and cracks in the music. He further treated the sounds with a spatializing reverb effect".  You can _literally_ __hear__ the tape fading away as this piece plays.  
    
	"Basinski finished the project the morning of the September 11, 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center in New York City, and sat on the roof of his apartment building in Brooklyn with friends as the towers collapsed. He filmed video footage of the attack's fallout during the last hour of daylight from a roof, and the following morning he played "Disintegration Loop 1.1" as a soundtrack to the aftermath. Stills from the video were used as the covers for the set of four CDs, and several weeks later Basinski used a post-script in his liner notes to dedicate the work to the victims.  He stated that "the events gave new meaning to the musical pieces created by catastrophic decay in my studio a few weeks before".
	
5. ["My Mom"](https://open.spotify.com/track/1MGioy7K2G6SIaVhdPAszg?si=FY1sT4WIR_O_O2WVYs9BJw) - Chocolate Genius (Black Music).  Throw aside the obvious "is that the name of a porn actor?" jokes.   This is the only song I've ever cried to on my first listen.  From [Genius.com](https://genius.com/Chocolate-genius-my-mom-lyrics): "The narrator back in the home he grew up in, interacting with his beloved mother whose memory has degenerated to the point that she no longer remembers his name".  My greatest fear with growing old is not that I'm going to die but that I'll be alive without memories.  To quote any specific lyrics from this song does is an injustice as you need to listen to the entire song.
		
6. ["The Philosopher"](https://open.spotify.com/track/7zKweXON2KcgXizqUcu7lf?si=y1c3A93uQf2exya11Faqdg) - Death (Individual Thought Patterns).  A little gallows humour considering my previous pick.  I am not quite sure where I first heard this song.  I used to go to a local comic shop (Tramps) that sold old guitar magazines for half price.  I bought a magazine that had a guitar and bass transcription for "The Philosopher".  What stood out for me when listening to this song for the first time was the outro.  While the song fades out it has guitar and bass solos.   During this, there was a weird sound that I couldn't figure out if it came from guitar or bass.  Looking at the transcription I found out what it was: a sliding harmonic on bass.  The bassist, [Steve Di Giorgio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVsp1WCbsoA), played a fretless bass on this recording!  This is one of the reasons why I've always wanted to play fretless bass.
	
	Useless Fact - One time in high school the store owner tried to confiscate my friend's disposable camera as he was in the "Adult Section" taking pictures of ["Willy Wanker at the Fudge Packing Factory"](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0129621/).
	  
7.  ["Svefn-g-englar"](https://open.spotify.com/track/07eGxuz8bL6QMsRqEe1Adu?si=63cd9da6b04340e0) - Sigur Rós (Ágætis Byrjun).  After high school a close friend of mine moved away.  It was the same friend with the disposable camera.  Every few weeks we would talk on the phone and chat about what music we were listening to.  He suggested this album.  He bought it after he read an article where [Kirk Hammett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirk_Hammett) of Metallica described it.  I only knew it wasn't a metal album and that the lyrics weren't in English.  The first time I listened to this album I wasn't sure if I liked it or not.  The more I listened, particularly to this song, the more I liked it.  This song could be described as melancholy with a faint hint of hope.  This song is also in the movie ["Vanilla Sky"](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0259711/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1) and I think that this song represents the atmosphere and feel of the movie.

8. ["You Are My Face"](https://open.spotify.com/track/6ntTz7uUloZeuVm6xDf78e?si=a00d404d77e3421f) - Wilco (Sky Blue Sky).  I lived in Lethbridge for two years while going to University.  I had a long-term relationship end while living there and this song just reminds me of that time.  It starts with a beautiful melody and harmonized vocals but changes around the 1:15 mark.  A guitar with delay plays this melody that sounds *ominous* and that it is leading up to something.  Two distorted, ascending guitar chords play and the song changes course.  This part of the song always reminds me of [Steely Dan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steely_Dan) for some reason, even though I'm not that familiar with them.  Guitarist [Nels Cline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nels_Cline) plays a frenetic guitar solo that sounds off key but fits the song (similar to [Marc Ribot's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Ribot) playing with [Tom Waits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Waits)).  [Jeff Tweedy's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Tweedy) vocals return and his emotions have changed.  "I have no idea how this happens \ All of my maps have been overthrown \ Happenstance has changed my plans \ So many times my heart has been outgrown".  The song continues in this fashion yet the band finds a way in the last minute of the song to return to the initial calmness that was present at the beginning of it.

9. ["Son et lumière/Inertiatic ESP"](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/59cyWImV6XTgGhNxowP0eI?si=d51b6c1a18724b94) - The Mars Volta (De-Loused in the Comatorium).  I'm listing these two songs as one track as they originally were supposed to be one song.  I remember being in Calgary and buying this album and Sparta's Wiretap Scars at the same time (both bands are made up of ex-members of At the Drive-In).  [Sparta's Wiretap Scars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiretap_Scars) was more accessible and I listened to it all that summer.  However, De-Loused in the Comatorium has stayed with me all these years.  This song has begins with a synth riff, cryptic vocals ("Clipside of the pinkeye flight\ I'm not the percent you think survives\ I need sanctuary in the pages of this book\ Gestating with all the other rats\ Nurse said that my skin will need a graft\ I am of pockmarked shapes\ The vermin you need to loathe"), there are drum fills and  "Inertiatic ESP" begins.  The song just goes all over the place.  It's chaotic and yet still fits altogether.  After the guitar solo there is part where it's only a guitar playing a riff for maybe 3-4 seconds.  It creates tension and when the band joins after the riff, it's disorganized yet still melodic.  This is one of the few albums where I feel guilty recommending a single song off this album as the album needs to be listened to in its entirety.  I know it is a concept album but I'll be damned if I ever fully understand what it is about.     

10. ["Schism"](https://open.spotify.com/track/55mJleti2WfWEFNFcBduhc?si=b8b350f050e347c1) - Tool (Lateralus).  Speaking of feeling guilty recommending a single song from an album, this is another example where the entire album needs to be listened to from beginning to end.  I was in Grade 12 when this album came out.  I got up early so I could buy it and listen to it before going to school (it was my last semester in school and I made sure that I only had classes in the afternoon).  I had heard Schism before the album as it was a single.  The riffs the bass plays is this song go all over the place in terms of [time signatures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schism_(song)#Time_signature) yet it still is catchy.  Just don't ask me to tap out the rhythm.   

11. ["Darkness"](https://open.spotify.com/track/7aewPE2qqi9OlnG4HSDZnO?si=ffbcad542e56496a) - Rage Against the Machine (The Crow: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack).  I started listening to Rage Against the Machine by happenstance.  I was in 6th grade, just had my birthday so I had birthday money to spend.  I was at the old [K-Mart Mall](https://www.cbc.ca/archives/the-240m-deal-that-meant-a-fast-farewell-for-kmart-in-canada-1.5443333) with my family (I'm not even sure if K-Mart was open at this time) and went to a music store.  They had band t-shirts and a Rage Against the Machine shirt was one of the cheaper ones so I bought it.  It had the band name on the front and something on the back that I wasn't quite sure what it was.  Later I found out that the [picture on the back](https://www.ragemerch.com/typewriter-molotov-t-shirt-6.html) was a hand lighting a Molotov cocktail.  At this point, I hadn't heard any of their music and my sister told me she had The Crow soundtrack and they had a song on it.  The song was "Darkness".  I listened and was hooked.  This was before mp3s so I had to save up my money and buy the CD without hearing any of their other songs as they weren't getting airplay on [MuchMusic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Much_(TV_channel)) and none of my friends had heard of them (this was before "Evil Empire" was released).  I bought the album in Grade 7 and became a huge fan.

12. ["Blacksteel in the Hour of Chaos"](https://open.spotify.com/track/4blNCZOOKSi1JCbZZmqEkJ?si=6a5279d85a364fe9) - Public Enemy  (It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back).  Speaking of Rage Against the Machine, I heard a cover of this song on a RATM bootleg (Live and Rare).  This was around the time you were able to download mp3s on dial-up and it took roughly 15-20 minutes per song.  The song was Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos and it goes into [Zapata's Blood](https://open.spotify.com/track/0I9E3nGW7HnZ38PQXbmG5J?si=1b469dfdf6a74618) right after (not the same version as is on the RATM bootleg).  [Chuck D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_D) from [Public Enemy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Enemy) comes out and raps the first verse with Zack de la Rocha.  At this point I was listening to and buying anything that had to do with Rage Against the Machine.  I went out and bought "It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back".  This song also stands out for me as it the first rap song that I can remember hearing that tells a story.  The first four lines are classic:  "I got a letter from the government/ The other day/ I opened and read it/ It said they were suckers".    

13. ["Rockin in the Free World"](https://open.spotify.com/track/4Y7fEQ4PAzhlLnLviRw2P4?si=5cc5aa1559354bae) - Neil Young (Freedom).  Arguably, the most well-known Neil Young song and I'm sure many diehard Neil Young fans would call me a poser for choosing this song.  One of the few songs that I can play on bass and guitar (minus the guitar solo) and have played it when jamming with friends a few times.  I also love that so many politicians choose it to play at campaign rallies without understanding that it's critiquing the free world.  I had the opportunity to see Neil Young in concert and this was the final song of the night.  He was 63 or 64 and he played his ass off.  There's a quote by Neil Young that describes his guitar playing and I think it's an accurate description of his playing in this song.  "I am a naturally very destructive person,” he says. “And that really comes out in my guitar playing. Man, if you think of guitar playing in terms of boxing…well let’s just say I’m not the kind of guitarist you’d want to play against. I’m just scarred by life. Nothing in particular. No more scarred than anyone else. Only other people often don’t let themselves know how damaged they are, like I do and deal with it.” (https://www.guitarworld.com/features/greatest-guitar-solos-all-time-readers-poll-round-2-one-kirk-hammett-vs)

14. ["Walk"](https://open.spotify.com/track/7fcfNW0XxTWlwVlftzfDOR?si=187c5b3901f54acc) - Pantera (Vulgar Display of Power).  I was lucky enough to see Pantera on their (I believe) final North American Tour (Extreme Steel Tour).  I first heard of them through the song "Walk" which I did in a Grade 9 talent show.  A buddy picked the song and we had an elaborate stage design that consisted of the [Pillsbury Doughboy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pillsbury_Doughboy) with horns on it and I believe 666 written on him.  I was [Dimebag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimebag_Darrell) and had a sweet cardboard guitar.  During the guitar solo I ripped off a tank top (which embarrassingly I couldn't do without a struggle) and had fake chest hair all over my body.  Another friend who was performing the song with me kicked the Pillsbury Doughboy into the crowd and ended up hitting a girl in the face with it.  Collateral damage.

15. ["Black Dog"](https://open.spotify.com/track/3qT4bUD1MaWpGrTwcvguhb?si=adf2c5cf734a4dcd) - Led Zeppelin (IV).  My sister bought me this album on record when I was in Grade 8 or 9.  She bought it because I had never heard Stairway to Heaven (no joke).  I think she partially bought it for herself too, but we all do that when we buy gifts for our siblings.  I remember hearing the intro to "Black Dog" with Robert Plante's vocals before Jimmy Page's triple-tracked monster guitar riff.  Some people say that the riff in Black Sabbath's ["Iron Man"](https://open.spotify.com/track/4svkPL62HbvyFgf0nHFXAF?si=af9163f36bcc4f48)  or Deep Purple's ["Smoke on the Water"](https://open.spotify.com/track/5SAUIWdZ04OxYfJFDchC7S?si=0ecf0e447ade4665) were the beginning of heavy metal/rock.  Even though "Iron Man" came out before this song, I would argue it isn't as heavy as the riff in this song.

16. ["Ol' 55"](https://open.spotify.com/track/7qbLE7ssJcnWD6EO7My847?si=02857f773e564c55) - Tom Waits (Closing Time).   My first introduction to Tom Waits was through his album [Rain Dogs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rain_Dogs) .   I enjoyed the eccentricities of this album, especially [Marc Ribot's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Ribot) outside guitar playing on it.  Waits' voice is definitely unique and the only person I think has a similar vocal style is [Captain Beefheart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_Beefheart).  Odds are that if you know of Captain Beefheart, you know of Tom Waits.  Waits' voice has been described by critic Daniel Durchholz as "sounding like it was soaked in a vat of bourbon, left hanging in the smokehouse for a few months, and then taken outside and run over with a car."(https://drownedinsound.com/artists/Tom_Waits).  Since I enjoyed the album, "Rain Dogs", I went back and started listening to his entire discography, starting with his first album "Closing Time".  It was a shocker as Tom Waits actually sings on this album.  The opening track, "Ol' 55", is classified a folk song and it sounds like Tom Waits is drunk off of alcohol, love or both.  

	  The [Eagles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eagles_(band)) [cover of this song](https://open.spotify.com/track/1mAI9jgfPWQTOE5PGPFPaP?si=4d38f15afa344d01) is abysmal.  In a "1975 interview, Waits was critical of the Eagles' cover version of his song, admitting that he was "not that particularly crazy about (their) rendition of it ... I thought their version was a little antiseptic."  About one year later, while interviewed for NME, he went as far as stating that "I don’t like the Eagles. They’re about as exciting as watching paint dry. Their albums are good for keeping the dust off your turntable and that’s about all." (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ol%27_%2755)
	  
17. ["King of Comedy"](https://open.spotify.com/track/0GxQN22aKRw9LjNUEW29OU?si=85260ea4095445aa) - REM (Monster).  In high school a friend of mine, the same friend who recommended [Sigur Rós'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigur_R%C3%B3s) - ["Ágætis Byrjun"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%81g%C3%A6tis_byrjun) album, would give me cds or create mix tapes for driving him around as he didn't have much money and couldn't afford to pay for gas.  I never asked for him to do this, but am thankful for it.  He made a mixtape of a variety of REM songs for me.  CD burners were around at this time as it was '00-'01 but my car didn't have a cd player.  At the time I hadn't listened to a lot of REM with the exception of their "Monster" album which came out in 1994.  I only listened to a few of the singles off the album which were "What's the Frequency Kenneth" and "Bang and Blame".  Besides that, I was only aware of their songs which were singles on other albums.  My friend put "King of Comedy" on the album and said it reminded him of a mutual friend of ours.  Listening to the album later on, it sounds like nothing else on "Monster".  My friend described the song as like it was sung by a robotic clown and for some reason reminded him of our friend.  I could barely understand the lyrics when I listened to it without looking it up but the one part that I could understand was the following: "Make your money with a pretty face \ Make it easy with product placement \ Make it charged with controversy \ I'm straight, I'm queer, I'm bi".  I knew that Michael Stipe's sexuality was questioned over the years and he never gave a straight answer (I hate myself for using such an obvious pun but I had to).  This is basically his way of giving the media the middle finger but at the same time not being ashamed of who he is.  It's his business, not yours.

18. ["Smile"](https://open.spotify.com/track/5707A8XNKQT26Ciek7H9KV?si=d1965ad93e0a4079) - Pearl Jam (No Code).  This isn't my favourite Pearl Jam song and not their best.  The lyrics are quite simple but for some reason the opening verse "Don't it make you smile? / Don't it make you smile? / When the sun don't shine, (It don't shine at all) / Don't it make you smile?" sticks in my head.  I'm not a huge fan of harmonica but it suits this song perfectly.  For the longest time, "Alive" by Pearl Jam was my favourite song but the fact I quoted in my graduation year yearbook makes me cringe ("I'm still alive" - [Eddie Vedder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddie_Vedder)).  I guess I was too dense to know what the song was really about.

19. ["Red Rover"](https://open.spotify.com/track/3GimOGNFE662Yj0ObNNKRi?si=5ed51531261c47ab) - Big Sugar (Brothers and Sisters, Are You Ready?).  Similar to the selection above, this isn't my favorite Big Sugar song but it stands out in my memories.  During their farewell tour of 2003 (which wasn't their last tour as they only broke up for a few years) I had the opportunity to see them live four times (twice in Medicine Hat and twice in Calgary).  The opening song for all these shows was this song.  There is a simple bass line intro and then the guitars hit.  Hard.  Watching them live, when the guitars kick in they literally hit you.  The band plays loud live.  Probably the loudest live band I've ever seen and they put on an amazing live show.

20. ["Heart of Darkness"](https://open.spotify.com/track/2oHafMbC4UXP6hzY6AJgi6?si=d4c828a90e174098) - Headstones (Headstones)/ (Honourable mention) The Misfits - ["Dig Up Her Bones"](https://open.spotify.com/track/5gHeUcDVjnDda7TABO9RYv?si=6492c7e38a4940d5) (American Psycho) - When I was 19 or 20, a friend of mine had an older Oldsmobile that he drove around in that had "theatre sound" (it had an audio system with a tape deck).  I remember these two songs being on a mixtape he made.  On "Heart of Darkness" Hugh Dillon sings "God loves me / God loves you / God loved Hitler and 6 million Jews / Must be a con who won´t come down from the mount / We do a death dance he does a body count".  I generally don't find Dillon to be that deep of a lyricist (maybe if his name was Hugh Dylan he might be...) but these lyrics are a middle finger to religion and those who say "God works in mysterious ways".  "Dig Up Her Bones" was also on this mixtape and even though I'm not that familiar with The Misfits, this is probably my favourite song by them and it doesn't even feature [Glenn Danzig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenn_Danzig) singing (it's [Michale Graves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michale_Graves)).  It's just a solid punk song and reminds me of driving around in his car.

21. ["Daylight"](https://open.spotify.com/track/3COHXcLRK9brRjMolzkD7Y?si=9d69a458fc764e02) - Aesop Rock (Labor Days).  Aesop is a lyrical genius (seriously, check out (https://pudding.cool/projects/vocabulary/index.html) as he's the rapper with "The Largest Vocabulary In Hip Hop").  I'm by no means a wordsmith and many of his songs go over my head in their meanings.  However, I understand most of "Daylight" and the chorus "All I ever wanted was to pick apart the day / Put the pieces back together my way" always sticks with me as I'm full of "what ifs..." at the end of every single day.   In the second verse Aesop drops the lines "Life's not a bitch / life is a beautiful woman / You only call her a bitch 'cause she won't let you get that pussy / Maybe she didn't feel y'all shared any similar interests / Or maybe you're just an asshole who couldn't sweet talk the princess" which is maybe the only time in a rap song where the word "pussy" is used in an arguably non-chauvinistic way.

22. ["When the Pin Hits the Shell"](https://open.spotify.com/track/5ZMYOEEbzR1UPWOHzQpzoA?si=de4ac7ebe9d7469f) - Drive-By Truckers (Decoration Day).   In my opinion, one of the Drive-By Truckers' most underrated songs.  A lot of [Mike Cooley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Cooley_(musician)) songs are hit or miss for me but when they hit, they hit hard.  I can't think of another song which makes you think of your youth while at the same time how things change and will never be the same.  "Me and you, we liked our pills and our whiskey. / But you don't want your head full of either one when / The house gets quiet and dark. / Having fun used to be so damned easy, / Racing trains from Second Street to Avalon. / Take a trip down memory lane, / You don't see no friendly faces / All the houses have been painted / and Nobody knows your name. / It's enough to make a man not want / To be nobody's Daddy, / When all he thinks he's got left to hand down is guilt and shame.""  This verse reminds me of a quote from, of all places, a video game.  There is a moment in the video game ["Night in the Woods"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_in_the_Woods)  where a character says "I stayed here and got older, while you went off and stayed the same.".  It reminds me of returning home after moving away for two years to go to university.  You want things to be the way they were before you left but people change whether you do or don't.

23. ["Speed Trap Town"](https://open.spotify.com/track/0Ex5dDCH0qz5ySfm3seYJr?si=3a08094f15a04bba) - Jason Isbell (Something More Than Free).  I can't bring up the [Drive-By Truckers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drive-By_Truckers) without mentioning Jason Isbell.  He is a former member of the band that has had a highly successful solo career since splitting with them.  In a song that's a little over four minutes, he has many memorable lines.  It would be easy enough to copy and paste all the lyrics to the song but here are a few that create a vivid picture whenever I hear them: 
      	
		"She said, "It's none of my business but it breaks my heart" 
		Dropped a dozen cheap roses in my shopping cart"
		"Well it's a Thursday night but there's a high school game 
		Sneak a bottle up the bleachers and forget my name"
		"It's a boy's last dream and a man's first loss"
		"I'll sleep until I'm straight enough to drive, then decide 
		If there's anything that can't be left behind"
		"How long can they keep you in the ICU? 
		Veins through the skin like a faded tattoo"
			
       I'm not a huge reader of fiction but I do like an author who can paint a picture in your mind with only a few words.  I would include Jason Isbell in this category.

24. ["Nothing's Funny"](https://open.spotify.com/track/5SAymv88YXD5vhmkRiVaWz?si=4183288d8b8149ed) - Dillinger Escape Plan (One of Us Is the Killer). This isn't my favourite song of theirs but probably the most accessible for the average listener (next to ["One of Us Is the Killer"](https://open.spotify.com/track/6bSZPUVSKdGjSdeEEPzycS?si=f17e50346a4a4f1d)).  This band is extremely heavy yet most of their songs are in standard tuning (a few tracks are in drop D).  Similar to [The Mars Volta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mars_Volta) and like  [Marc Ribot's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Ribot) playing with [Tom Waits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Waits)), there is a lot of dissonance with the chord voicings that guitarist, [Ben Weinman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Weinman), chooses to use.  This song showcases this with the verse having odd chords yet the chorus is melodic.  A bit of [mathcore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathcore) yin and yang.     

25. ["Slow Down Ghandi"](https://open.spotify.com/track/0jZ9HDHVcUkYYN3xLXgEEG?si=799f0375565b471c) - Sage Francis (A Healthy Distrust).  There are some songs where essays could be written about the content within them (for example, the majority of songs by [Rage Against the Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rage_Against_the_Machine)).  This is conscious hip-hop that isn't preachy.  While this album is pretty solid through out, this song stands out.  The following lines are from the first verse:  

		"The West Memphis Three lost paradise
		It's death penalty versus suicidal tendencies
		All I wanted was a fucking Pepsi
		Institution
		Making you think you're crazy is a billion-dollar industry
		If they could sell sanity in a bottle
		They'd be charging for compressed air
		And marketing healthcare"

Sage's referencing the song ["Institutionalized"](https://open.spotify.com/track/7G83ZwD2msTtFaBQExc8QB?si=bcb869d01beb4d91) by [Suicidal Tendencies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicidal_Tendencies) with quoting the line "All I wanted was a fucking Pepsi" is a brilliant nod to them and their song before criticizing commercialism.  This song needs to be listened to multiple times to get all the references.    

Most hated song: The J. Geils Band - ["Freeze-Frame"](https://open.spotify.com/track/6QqK6a1CmV4L504uMQaGDH?si=262589fb73c34e65) (Freeze-Frame).  I despise this song.  Everything from the cheesy [Casio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casio) (?) keyboard intro to the god-awful chorus that is just the word "Freeze-frame" repeated (yes, I know the last two words of the chorus are "now freeze" but I made my point).  Even [Van Halen's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Halen) awful song ["Jump"](https://open.spotify.com/track/6Fba9RZtC6vTY814JToDtP?si=889f1a7706264110) has a chorus that has "might as well jump, go ahead and jump".  The song sounds like an ad-exec pitched it for a Polaroid camera commercial.  I used to work a fast food job where this song would play on the radio every 3-4 hours and it made me want to deep fry my ears.  Luckily, I was smart enough to just leave the kitchen when it was playing and return when it finished.   I don't hate everything J. Geils has done as I do like ["Centerfold"](https://open.spotify.com/track/1ynmMEK1fkyiZ6Z6F3ThEt?si=ecf95d4b67924c9c) and ["Love Stinks"](https://open.spotify.com/track/3K9QlS0VCtkzUvo0HY75VE?si=0fb2494440e74a09).  However, that doesn't redeem the band for this drivel.
